    "1. Explain what CORS is and what it stands for\n",
    "- Cross-origin resource sharing is a set of techniques used to prevent web pages from accessing resources on other domains without permission. It adds HTTP headers to a web bpage in order to inform the browser whether access is allowed. \n",
    "2. Describe how you would be able to implement CORS into your own websites\n",
    "- You would need to add specific HTTP headers to your server that indicate which domains/origins are allowed to access the resources. I would need to determine which origins I want or need to restrict, then use Access-Control-Allow-Origin, which specifies the domains allowed.  \n",
    "3. Describe why you would want to implement CORS into your own websites\n",
    "- By implementing CORS, I can control which domains are allowed to access my resources, and prevent unauthorized access. This may include attackers trying to steal data, or put malicious code on your site. CORS is a security measure that ensures the safety of you and all your website's users.\n",
    "4. How could use CORS to benefit yourself in the future?\n",

    "- Deploying KASM, a container-based streaming service, requires several components such as headers, NGINX, load balancing, configuration, DNS, and CORS. These components are important for setting up the KASM service, configuring security settings, managing incoming web traffic, distributing traffic across multiple server instances, mapping the KASM domain name to its IP address, and enabling cross-origin resource sharing.
