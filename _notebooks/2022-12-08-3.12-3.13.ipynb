    " - A **procedure** is a named set of instructions that can take in parameters and return values\n",
    "    - May be called \"method\" or \"function\" in different programming languages\n",
    "- **Parameters** are independent variables used in the procedure to produce a result\n",
    "    - Allows procedure to execute without initially knowing specific input values\n",
    "    - used to make functions work with multiple different inputs\n",
    "- To call a procedure you write the name of the procedure followed by the parentheses with the parameters\n",
    "    - procedureName(parameter1, parameter2, ...)\n",
    "    - Procedures do not require parameters, but parentheses is required\n",
    "- Using syntax, you can determine the result with **function parameters** and **return value** and **statements**\n",
    "    - To use function parameters, paremeters used when calling the function in order to get result,you would have to write the syntax name of function followed by parameters in parentheses\n",
    "- A return statement exits a function and instructs python to continue executing the program and return a certain value\n",
    "    - Value can be string, tuple, etc. being sent back to the main program\n",
    "- **Modularity**: the practive of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts that can be used/reused in different parts of the program\n",
    "- **Abstraction**: the practice of hiding the details of how a code/system works, only exposing essential functions necessary for other parts of the program\n",
    "- **Duplication**: Having multiple duplicate code blocks decreasing efficiancy\n",
    "- **Logic**: the sequence of steps that a computer follows to execute a program\n",
    "- **Procedure Name**: name that is given to a procedure, to call it\n",
    "- **Arguments**: way to provide info to a function, defined outside a function then imported into a function with parameters\n",
    "- in python, **def** defines function"
