    "## Notes\n",
    "- An algorithm is a finite set of instruction that accomplish a task\n",
    "    - it can be expressed by natural language, diagrams, etc.\n",
    "    - Every algorithm can be created by a mixture of sequencing, selection, and iteration\n",
    "- A sequence is the order of how to do something to achieve a result\n",
    "    - i.e. how you follow the instructions from a teacher\n",
    "- A selection allows an algorithm to make a decision based on if a condition is met\n",
    "    - i.e. when your car is out of fuel, you go to the gas station to fill your car, but if your car is full you wouldn't go to the gas station\n",
    "- An iteration is a loop and doing something again until a condition is met\n",
    "    - i.e. you put away your computer when you are finished with your work\n",
    "- Sequential statements are used in processes to specify how signals are assigned\n",
    "- After all the sequential statements in the process are executed the signals are assigned in order their new values\n",
    "- Arithmetic operator is language that use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division(/), and modulus (%)\n",
    "- String concatenation joins two or more strings end-to-end to make a new string\n",
    "- A substring is part of an existing string"
