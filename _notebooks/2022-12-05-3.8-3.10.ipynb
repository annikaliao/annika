    "- Iteration: a repeating portion of an algorithm, repeats a specified number of times or until a given condition is met\n",
    "- Iteration Statements: change the sequential flow of control by repeating a set of statements zero or more times, until a stopping condition is met\n",
    "- Repeat Until: if the condition evaluates to true initially, the loop body is not executed at all, due to the condition being checked before the loop\n",
    "- Range function: use variable to represent what the range of numbers the output can show. Use with for loop\n",
    "    - when using the range function, the last number, or the ending value, is not included in the output, therefore we would have to add 1 to receive the correct output\n",
    "- For loop: process stops if next element meets statement\n",
    "- While loop: process is repeated until statement is met\n",
    "- In lists: \n",
    "    - append(): adding element to the end of the list\n",
    "    - insert(): adding an element in a specific position\n",
    "    - remove(): remove an item from a list\n",
    "    - len(): returns number of items in a list\n",
    "    - sort(): permanently changes order of list \n",
    "    - sorted(): returns copy of list, leaving original copy unchanged\n",
    "    - range(): range of number able to use, makes working with numbers more efficient\n",
    "    - min(): find the least value in a list\n",
    "    - max(): find highest value in a list\n",
    "    - sum(): sum of all values in a list\n",
    "- Traversing a list is process of visiting each element in a list in a sequential order. Used to access, search for, and modify elements in the list\n",
    "    - Complete Traversal: All elements in a list are assessed \n",
    "    - Partial Traversal: Only a given portion of elements are assessed\n",
    "    - Iterative Traversal: When loops are used to iterate through a list and to access each single element at a time.\n"
