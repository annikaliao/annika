    "You are Player A. You can input whether you want to shoot rock, paper or scissors. At random, either rock, paper, or scissors, will be assigned to Player B. If the two players' values are equal, then they will both receive a point. If one player gets rock and the other paper, paper will win, and that player will receive a point. This will also apply to scissors beating paper and rock beating scissors. The first player to receive 3 points wins the game, and the simulation stops. \n",

    "The rolling dice simulator asks the user to choose an amount of dice to roll (1 through 6). Then, once there is an input, the simulator outputs dice rolls (a value 1 through 6), the number of times chosen by the user. For example, I chose 2 dice, and I received the values 6 and 1. This simulates the dice rolls I would roll on 2 dice in real life. \n",

    "I coded the simulation that I had described in Hack 1. I coded a rock paper scissors game where you are playing against a computer with randomized outputs. The first one to score 3 points wins! You score a point when your throw beats the computer. Rock wins scissors, paper wins rock, and scissors wins paper. If tied, you both score a point. This may not be authentic to a real life experiment, because the machine doesn't take in outside factors, such as the other player's strategies. They could throw late, allowing them to see you you throw before throwing themselves. "
