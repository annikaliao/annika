    "You are Player A. You can input whether you want to shoot rock, paper or scissors. At random, either rock, paper, or scissors, will be assigned to Player B. If the two players' values are equal, then they will both receive a point. If one player gets rock and the other paper, paper will win, and that player will receive a point. This will also apply to scissors beating paper and rock beating scissors. The first player to receive 3 points wins the game, and the simulation stops. \n",

    "The rolling dice simulator asks the user to choose an amount of dice to roll (1 through 6). Then, once there is an input, the simulator outputs dice rolls (a value 1 through 6), the number of times chosen by the user. For example, I chose 2 dice, and I received the values 6 and 1. This simulates the dice rolls I would roll on 2 dice in real life. \n",
