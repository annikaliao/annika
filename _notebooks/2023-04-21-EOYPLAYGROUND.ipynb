    "  1. What are some examples of 2D arrays?\n",
    "     - Spreadsheets, images, chessboard, etc. They all consist of rows and columns.\n",
    "  2. What is a modern day game that could be classified as a 2D array?\n",
    "     - Sudoku is a 2D array game. The game is played on a 9x9 grid of squares, which is rows and columns, so it can be conisdered a 2D array. \n",
    "  3. Describe a 2D array in your own words\n",
    "     - A 2D array is a data collection type where data is indexed by two indices. It is visually comprised of 2 dimensions (hence 2D), which are rows and columns, so it is structured like a table. It can also be visualized as a collection of arrays, with each array representing a row of data (basically lists within a list).\n",
    "  4. What is the definition of iteration in your own words\n",
    "     - Iteration is the process of repeating an operation or block of code multiple times. This usually takes place in a loop, until a condition is met, then it stops. \n",
    "  5. Explain how the game relates to iteration\n",
    "     - Iteration is used to create an array of movements and execute them in a sequence. It allows the code to repeat the certain instruction a certain amount of times. Without it, the code would manually execute each movement, which is not efficient. \n",
    "  6. What parts of the code use iteration\n",
    "     - There are several for loops in the code. The one that iterates over the looper variable determines how many times the set of movements should be excuted. The four for loops within that add movement to the array.\n",
    "  7. Explain which parts of the code use lists\n",
    "     - At the beginning of the code, a list of string words are assigned to the variable word_list. The random module selects one of these items from the list to scramble for the game\n",
    "  8. Explain what list manipulation is happening in that part\n",
    "     - There is list manipulation happening through the random.sample() function. The function returns a list of the string scrambled. The items of the list is being manipulated, by having the letters be mixed up. \n",

    " - [x] Explain how the tic tac toe game works\n",
    "   - The tic tac toe game uses a 2d array to represent a 3x3 board. It initially starts off empty, and is printed to the user. The user is instructed to enter the value of the row and column of where they want to position their X or O symbol. If the move is valid (position not already taken), then the board is updated with the symbol in place. Then, the check_win() function checks whether there are any instances of 3 X's or 3 O's in a row, vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. If there are, then the game ends and the winner is declared. A tie can also be checked, when all the spaces are filled up and there are no wins. The game continues in a loop, where each player inputs the position of their respective symbol, until a player wins or there is a tie.\n",
