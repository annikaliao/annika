    "In this example code, we first import the necessary libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. We then load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame using the pd.read_csv() function. We print the first 5 rows of the DataFrame using the df.head() function. Next, we calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the 'MPG' column using the appropriate Pandas methods, and print the results. And, we create a histogram of the 'MPG' column using Matplotlib by calling the plt.hist() function and setting appropriate axis labels and a title. We then call the plt.show() method to display the plot. Even though NumPy is not directly used in this code, it is an important underlying component of the pandas and Matplotlib libraries, which are used to load, manipulate and visualize data. It allows them to work more efficiently"

    "#### Summary/Goals of Lesson:\n",
    "One of our goals was to make you understand data analysis and how it can be important in optimizing business performance. We also wanted to make sure you understood the use of Pandas and NumPy libraries in data analysis, with a focus on NumPy. As someone who works with data, we find Pandas incredibly useful for manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing data in Python. The way we use pandas is to calculate individual player and team statistics. We are a group that works with numerical data, so NumPy is one of our favorite tools for working with arrays and applying mathematical functions to them. It is very fast at computing and manipulating arrays making it a very valuable tool for tracking statistics which is important to our group. For example, if you have an array of the points scored by each player in a game, you can use NumPy to calculate the total points scored, average points per player, or the highest and lowest scoring players.\n",

    "What is NumPy and how is it used in data analysis?\n",
    "- NumPy is a Python library used for math and data analysis. It provides efficient mathematical operations on arrays, such as algebra and graphing. It is commonly used in data analysis for array manipulation, indexing, sorting, and filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is Pandas and how is it used in data analysis?\n",
    "- Pandas is a Python library that has tools for data structures and analysis. It has objects for manipulating data tables and manipulating arrays. It is used in data analysis for data cleaning, merging, and visualization. \n",
    "\n",
    "How is NunPy different than Pandas for data analysis?\n",
    "- NumPy is more geared towards mathematical numerical computations, and Pandas is more geared towards data manipulation and analysis. One is math, one is data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a DataFrame?\n",
    "- A Dataframe is data structure in Pandas that looks like a table or spreadsheet. It was rows and columns, holding data by column. \n",
    "\n",
    "What are some common operations you can perform with NunPy?\n",
    "- With NumPy, you can calculate percentiles, average, standard deviation, and correlation. \n",
    "\n",
    "How Can You Incorporate Either of these Data Analysis Tools (NunPy, Pandas) into your project?\n",
    "- I can use Pandas, along with Matplotlib, in my period tracker project, to provide a visual presentation of what the user's period patterns may look like. I can also use NumPy to make the calculations of average period length, and compare user periods with other users.\n",
