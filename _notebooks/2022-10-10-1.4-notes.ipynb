    "> - For errors in an algorithm or program, **identify the error**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Errors are part of the programming progress\n",
    "- Identify one of four errors: \n",
    "    - **Logic error**\n",
    "        - Mistake in the algorithm or program that causes it to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly\n",
    "    - **Syntax error** \n",
    "        - Mistake in the program where the rules of the programming language are not followed\n",
    "        - Causes the program to fail to run/compile\n",
    "        - Common examples of this are forgetting to include: colon/semicolon, parenthesis, curly brackets, indentation, quotes, variable definition\n",
    "    - **Run-time error** \n",
    "        - Mistake in the program that occurs during the execution of a program\n",
    "        - Programming languages define their own runtime errors\n",
    "        - AKA \"bug\"\n",
    "        - The key to identifying a run-time error is that the program runs/compiles initially, but fails and cannot complete its processes\n",
    "        - A run-time error may result from: dividing by zero, inappropriately entered data type, many other advanced possibilities\n",
    "    - **Overflow error**\n",
    "        - Error that occurs when a computer attempts to handle a number that is outside of the defined range of values\n",
    "        - Due to memory allocation constraints that programming languages require, certain values are too big to calculate and/or display\n",

    "> - For errors in an algorithm or program, **correct the error**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ways to find and correct errors: \n",
    "    - test cases\n",
    "    - hand tracing\n",
    "    - visualizations\n",
    "    - debuggers\n",
    "    - adding extra output statement\n",
    "- The easiest error to correct is usually the syntax error\n",
    "    - Most integrated development environments (IDEs) display information when there is a syntax error\n",
    "    - This information usually directs the programmer to the line in the program where the error has occurred\n",
    "    - Sometimes the user needs to do a little digging to find the error \n",
    "- More difficult to find and correct are logic errors\n",
    "    - A logic error is not always immediately noticed\n",
    "    - Using multiple test cases is the first strategy programmers use to find logic errors\n",
    "- Hand-tracing is most useful with iteration (loops)\n",
    "    - Hand tracing is simply writing out the values of the variables within the loop as it iterates to determine if the outcome is correct\n",
    "    - Hand tracing can be useful for small code segments and loops that iterate a small number of times\n",
    "    - Larger code segments or loops might require a debugging program\n",
    "- Another strategy is adding extra output statements\n",
    "    - A programmer would use this strategy to help find and fix an error\n",
    "    - Once the error is corrected, the extra output statements are usually removed\n",
    "    - This has a similar effect as hand tracing, but allows the computer to do more of the work\n",
    "- If those strategies fail\n",
    "    - Some IDEs allow programmers to use visualizations and/or debuggers \n",
    "        - Visualiztions show graphs, images, color etc. that help determine if a program is working correctly\n",
    "        - Debuggers use software designed to run a program, allowing it to be paused and tested iin the midst of running to determine if it is working properly\n",

    "> - Identify inputs and corresponding expected outputs or behaviors that can be used to check the correctness of an algorithm or program\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start thinking about testing at the onset of development\n",
    "- In the development process, testing uses defined inputs to ensure that an algorithm or program is producing the expected outcomes\n",
    "- Specifications influence testing\n",
    "    - Specifications list behaviors, events, corresponding responses/outputs the program supports\n",
    "    - Programmers need to define inputs that will determine whether or not the program specifications are met\n",
    "- Testing program development\n",
    "    - Once the inputs and corresponding outputs are determined, programmers test\n",
    "    - After testing, programmers use the results the revise, refine, and improve their programs.\n",
    "    - And then they test them again and again.\n",
    "    - After the programmers test, then users test, and then the programmers refine even more\n",
    "    - And finally, the program is released\n",
