## Test Corrections

I scored 49/50. I got Q50 wrong. 

### Q50
> Which algorithms run in reasonable time

I struggled with this question, but I did end up getting the correct answer. There was an error while submitting and I resubmitted, but I didn't realize my recent work didn't save.

Anyway, I understand that algorithms A and D are the most efficinet algorithms, as algorithm B uses 2^n for its number of steps, meaning the steps will increase exponentially, which means it will end up with more steps than those that are arithmetic. It may seem that B has the least amount of steps because it has one of the least at list 5, but the number of steps grows faster. We didn't discuss this topic in class, so I initially had a bit of trouble.

## Reflection

I was able to understand most if not of the questions, and get the right answers. I worked together with Claire C., which helped a lot. We caught each other on the silly mistakes, and talked out the tougher problems. This included a lot of the robot questions. I think I will need to go over some of the key terms that we didn't learn so much in class, such as for the topic of security (I didn't know what a Creative Commons license is, so I struggled with that question). I will also work on binary search and identifying algorithms, to get more comfortable with those concepts and processes.
