## Test Score

## Reflection

I scored 50/50, but I did struggle with some of the questions. I struggled with the questions about binary, because I am not confident with the concepts yet, but I am starting to understand it. I will practice and study binary more. However, all of the other data and metadata analysis questions were pretty easy and clear for me to understand. Data compression questions were the easiest for me. Overall, I am pretty confident with Big Idea 2.
