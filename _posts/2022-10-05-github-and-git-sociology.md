## Sociology Questions

**What is the main repository for your project?**


**Did you create a .gitignore to avoid committing files that ‘don’t belong in version control?**


**Do you have a requirements.txt file to manage dependencies introduced to your Code Base?**


**Have you established Issues as part of your Development process?**
Yes, we are creating Issues for various steps of our Development process to track our progress, and plan out the next steps. 

**Have you considered making Pull Requests to track development?**
 

**Have you considered forks or branching techniques with pull requests?**


**Are you managing Issues on a Project Board/Scrum Board like Kanban?**
Yes, we plan to consistently manage a [Scrum Board](https://github.com/users/haeryny/projects/1/views/1) with Issues documenting what we've done, what is in progress, and what is completed. This will help us keep our Development process running smoothly and efficiently.
