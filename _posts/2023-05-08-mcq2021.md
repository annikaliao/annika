## Test Corrections

I scored 64/70. I got questions 48, 55, 57, 60, 66, and 68 wrong. 

### Q48

Tricking a user into providing personal information is an example of a phishing attack. While this type of attack can be used to obtain personal information, it does not allow unauthorized individuals to intercept information transmitted on a network. A rogue access point is a wireless access point that gives unauthorized access to secure networks. Data sent over public networks can be intercepted, analyzed, and modified. One way that this can happen is through a rogue access point.

### Q55

The incorrect code segment removes the last element of the list, then attempts to access an element at index len. This causes an error because there is no longer an element at index len. The correct code segment assigns the value of the last element of the list to the variable temp, then removes the last element of the list, then inserts temp as the first element of the list.

### Q57

Running processes P and R on one processor will take a total of 50 seconds. Running processes Q and S on the other processor will take a total of 25 seconds. With the processors running in parallel, this solution will take 50 seconds; the optimal solution takes only 40 seconds. With two processors running in parallel, execution time is minimized when the processors take on as close to an equal workload as possible. Running processes P and Q on one processor will take a total of 40 seconds. Running processes R and S on the other processor will take a total of 35 seconds. As the processors run in parallel, all four operations are completed in 40 seconds.

### Q60

The application only sends notifications to compatible users who are nearby. Since not all people will be considered compatible, users are unlikely to be able to identify all other users in the area. The application can be used to connect users with other nearby users, which may encourage users to exercise together. This may have the effect of improving user health.

### Q66

This code segment does not work as intended. For example, if timer is greater than 60, bonus is assigned 1500 in the first IF block. Then bonus is assigned 1000 in the second IF block. As a result, bonus will be assigned 1000 instead of the intended 1500. In D, if timer is greater than 60, bonus is assigned 1500 in the first IF block. If timer is between 30 and 60, inclusive, bonus is assigned 1000 in the second IF block. If timer is less than 30, bonus is assigned 500 in the third IF block. The correct number of bonus points is assigned to bonus for all possible values of timer. A assigns 500 bonus points by default. If timer is less than 30, no additional bonus points are added. If timer is between 30 and 60 inclusive, bonus is incremented by 500 in the first IF block. If timer is greater than 60, bonus is incremented by 500 twice (once in each IF block). The correct number of bonus points is assigned to bonus for all possible values of timer.

### Q68

The code segment will iterate over myList from right to left, removing the sixth element (20), the third element (30), and the second element (30). This results in the list [30, 10, 20], which contains no duplicates, as intended. A will iterate over myList from right to left, removing each element that is equal in value to the element immediately preceding it. For this list, the code segment will remove the sixth element (10), the fourth element (20), and the second element (10). This results in the list [10, 20, 10], which still contains duplicates. C will iterate over myList from right to left, removing each element that is equal in value to the element immediately preceding it. This list does not contain any pairs of adjacent elements that are equal in value, so no elements will be removed even though the value 40 appears twice in the list.
