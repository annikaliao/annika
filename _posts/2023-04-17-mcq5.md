## Test Corrections

![](https://i.imgur.com/a7oUsZG.jpg)

I scored 63/66. I got questions 14, 29, and 65 wrong. 

### Q14

Both programs display ten values. The programs each display ten values, but each value displayed by program B is one greater than the corresponding value from program A. Program A displays 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and program B displays 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11.

### Q29

With these inputs, the AND gate will produce an output of false and the first OR gate will produce an output
of true. The second OR gate will have one false input and one true input, causing the circuit to have an output of true. With these inputs, the AND gate will produce an output of false and the first OR gate will produce an output of false. Since both inputs to the second OR gate will be false, the circuit will have an output of false.

### Q65

If y is negative, then the condition count equals y will never be met since count begins at 0 and repeatedly increases. If y is negative, then the condition count equals y will never be met since count begins at 0 and repeatedly increases. If x is negative and y is positive, the procedure will correctly calculate the product by adding x to itself y times. 

## Reflection

I am making silly mistakes on procedure and boolean questions. I understand the concepts after I learn the answers, but it may be confusing to me when I read the question, making me make a mistake. I will practice these problems more and watch the CB videos. I am also still a little uncomfortable with licensing and security questions, because there are terms to be memorized that I don't quite have down. I am most comfortable with using programs with data nad data compression.
