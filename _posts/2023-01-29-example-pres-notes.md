## Rebecca and Aadya's Project notes
- Include CRUD (create, remove, update, delete)
- User data is saved in backend, making functionality wider
- Model, View, Control
    - Data is sent to a database for admin
    - Only admin has control over data
    - New files from user are automatically saved
- Keep a scrum board with issues, with tasks and goals through the week
    - Tracks progress, making project run efficiently
- How project applies to College Board standards

## Reflection on our Project
- We will have to think more about how our project meets the College Board requirements
    - We can do this by starting off with an outline, meeting all the standards, then building up the design and code from there
- We will have to figure out how to utilize backend for our project
    - Think CRUD and Model, View, Control
    - We can store user information and their menstrual information to increase the functionality of our trackers
- We will update our Scrum Board frequently, preferably every week
    - Set goals for completion for each week
