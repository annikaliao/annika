## Concept
We're creating an interactive journal that allows users to track moods, plan out their week, and journal about their day.  

### Program Purpose and Function
The purpose of the program is to provide a platform in which users can schedule and plan out their day, as well as take into account their mindfulness and mental health.

### Data Abstraction
Information such as ratings and scales for moods and characteristics will be stored in lists, which demonstrates data abstraction.

### Managing Complexity
The list will contain moods to select from, which is one of the main points of our program, and is essential in the program's function. 

### Procedural Abstraction
The procedures will involve creating events or tasks, creating journal entries, and selecting moods. The parameters will limit the moods you are able to choose, as well as jou

### Algorithm Implementation
Looping through days and months and years will require algorithm implementation

### Testing
There can be functions such as "overview of your week" that need to call different values from different places.
