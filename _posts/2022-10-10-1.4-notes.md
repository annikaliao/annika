title: 1.4 Identifying and Correcting Errors

## Daily Video 1
> Learning Objectives:
> - For errors in an algorithm or program, **identify the error**

- Errors are part of the programming progress
- Identify one of four errors: 
    - **Logic error**
        - Mistake in the algorithm or program that causes it to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly
    - **Syntax error** 
        - Mistake in the program where the rules of the programming language are not followed
        - Causes the program to fail to run/compile
        - Common examples of this are forgetting to include: colon/semicolon, parenthesis, curly brackets, indentation, quotes, variable definition
    - **Run-time error** 
        - Mistake in the program that occurs during the execution of a program
        - Programming languages define their own runtime errors
        - AKA "bug"
        - The key to identifying a run-time error is that the program runs/compiles initially, but fails and cannot complete its processes
        - A run-time error may result from: dividing by zero, inappropriately entered data type, many other advanced possibilities
    - **Overflow error**
        - Error that occurs when a computer attempts to handle a number that is outside of the defined range of values
        - Due to memory allocation constraints that programming languages require, certain values are too big to calculate and/or display

## Daily Video 2
> Learning Objectives:
> - For errors in an algorithm or program, **correct the error**

- Ways to find and correct errors: 
    - test cases
    - hand tracing
    - visualizations
    - debuggers
    - adding extra output statement
- The easiest error to correct is usually the syntax error
    - Most integrated development environments (IDEs) display information when there is a syntax error
    - This information usually directs the programmer to the line in the program where the error has occurred
    - Sometimes the user needs to do a little digging to find the error 
- More difficult to find and correct are logic errors
    - A logic error is not always immediately noticed
    - Using multiple test cases is the first strategy programmers use to find logic errors
- Hand-tracing is most useful with iteration (loops)
    - Hand tracing is simply writing out the values of the variables within the loop as it iterates to determine if the outcome is correct
    - Hand tracing can be useful for small code segments and loops that iterate a small number of times
    - Larger code segments or loops might require a debugging program
- Another strategy is adding extra output statements
    - A programmer would use this strategy to help find and fix an error
    - Once the error is corrected, the extra output statements are usually removed
    - This has a similar effect as hand tracing, but allows the computer to do more of the work
- If those strategies fail
    - Some IDEs allow programmers to use visualizations and/or debuggers 
        - Visualiztions show graphs, images, color etc. that help determine if a program is working correctly
        - Debuggers use software designed to run a program, allowing it to be paused and tested iin the midst of running to determine if it is working properly

## Daily Video 3
> Learning Objectives:
> - Identify inputs and corresponding expected outputs or behaviors that can be used to check the correctness of an algorithm or program

- Start thinking about testing at the onset of development
- In the development process, testing uses defined inputs to ensure that an algorithm or program is producing the expected outcomes
- Specifications influence testing
    - Specifications list behaviors, events, corresponding responses/outputs the program supports
    - Programmers need to define inputs that will determine whether or not the program specifications are met
- Testing program development
    - Once the inputs and corresponding outputs are determined, programmers test
    - After testing, programmers use the results the revise, refine, and improve their programs.
    - And then they test them again and again.
    - After the programmers test, then users test, and then the programmers refine even more
    - And finally, the program is released

## Hacks
- What errors may arise in your project?
    - There are some guaranteed some coding issues, as most members of our group are completely new to coding and programming. This means there will probably a lot of logic and syntax errors. 
- What are some test cases that can be used?
    - I plan to use as many test cases as I can to make the project run as smoothly as possible. This includes using functionability, performance, database test cases, etc.
