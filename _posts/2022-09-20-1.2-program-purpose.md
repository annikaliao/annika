## 1.2 Daily Video 1
> Learning Objectives:
> - Describe the purpose of a computing innovation

### Computing Innovations
- **The purpose of computing innovations is to solve prpoblems or to pursue interests through creative expression**
- Categories of innovations
    - Applications
        - Games
        - Social media
        - Business
        - Productivity
    - Physical devices
        - Computers
        - Smartphones/tablets
        - Wearables
    - Systems
        - E-commerce
        - Cloud services
        - E-mail

### Innovations created for a purpose
- **An understanding of the purpose of a computing innovation provides developers with an improved ability to develop that computing innovation**
- When thinking about innovations created for a purpose, think about the guiding questions:
    - Why does the computing innovation exist?
    - What problems does the computing innovation solve?
    - What does the computing innovation allow us to do that we could not do before?

### Examples of Computing Innovations
- Social media applications
    - Allows users to connect from a distance and archive their activies
- E-commerce
    - Allows users to save time and money by being able to shop from home
- Digital assistant device
    - Allows users to control their devices hands-free, making them safer while driving or more convenient when multitasking

## 1.2 Daily Video 2
> Learning Objectives:
> - Identify input(s) to a program
> - Identify output(s) producced by a program

### Identifying Inputs to Programs
- **Program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program**
- Computer programs accept input in various forms: tactile, audio, visual, text

### How do programs receive input?
- **"Events" are triggered by some action, which usually sends input to the program**
    - i.e. mouse clicks, screen-taps, button clicks, keyboard entries, audio triggers
- **Input can come from a user or other programs**

### What does input accomplish in a program?
- **Input usually affects the output**
- **Program outputs are any data sent from a program to a device**
- Outputs produced by devices: visual, audio, tectile, text

### How does a program know what to do upon an event?
- **In event-driven programming, program statements are executed when triggered, rather than through the sequential flow of control**
- An action triggers an event
    - Action may be initiated by the user or another program/device
- The program "jumps" to the code segment according to the event
    - The code segment is executed
    - Output is triggered by the code segment (or additional events)
- The program code is not necessarily executed in order
    - Code segments are executed as they are called according to the events triggered
- **Program output is usually based on a program's input or prior state**
    - i.e. internal values

## 1.2 Daily Video 3
> Learning Objectives:
> - Explain how a program or code segment functions

### What is a program? 
- **A program is a collection of statements that performs a specific task when run by a computer**
    - A statement is a single command
    - **A group of statements part of a program is called a code segment**
    - Code segments are executed according to the rules of the programming language
    - A program is often referred to as software
- **The behavior of a program is how a program functions during execution and is often descirbed by how a user interacts with it**

### Program Function 
- **A program needs to work for a variety of inputs and situations**
    - Code segment would need to work for a variety of lists
    - Code segment could be inserted into a larger program
- **A program can be described broadly by what it does, or in more detail by both what the program does and how the program statements accomplish this function**
- Description should:
    - state the function simply so someone could use the code segment in a larger program
    - include how it functions by explaining in detail how the code segment functions

## Our Team's Final Project
- Do we have final project ideas for a PBL Web Project?
    - Yes, our team is planning to create a productive planner with many different uses.
- Are we considering a project that is best for our educational purpose?
    - Yes, most of us have minimal coding experience, so by creating a not too complicated but still useful application, we will all learn a lot. We can even utilize the application ourselves after it is complete.
- Is the project going to hold team members interest for 8 weeks?
    - Yes, there are many different elements to incorporate into this project. Even if we somehow complete our original plan, there is big capacity for new other elements to be implemented.
- Does the project have potential for someone to use it beyond the 8 weeks? ie Customer or Sponsor needed?
    - Yes, this application is very useful and can be utilized by anyone. A planner is something everyone needs, we are just making it even more convenient and useful.
- Does the project have potential to be used for Create Performance Task submission?
    - Yes, in our project there are many ways to implement code that includes sequencing, selection and iteration, procedures and lists, etc. in a functionable and creative way
