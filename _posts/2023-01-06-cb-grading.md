Most of my scoring was the same as College Board, but on some categories I gave the student a point whereas College Board did not, such as the Managing Complexity row. The student missed the categories Program Purpose and Function and Managing Complexity. They did not include a correct program purpose, instead describing the function. When grading, I was hesitant on marking off the program purpose, so I will also have to work on differentiating program purpose and functionality. They included a list, however, it was not necessary for the program, so it did not manage complexity. I will have to work on knowing what lists are actually effective in managing complexity, as the student's did not, and I thought it did.

My scoring was the same as College Board, the student met all of the requirements. The written response was very detailed and concise, with all the requirements met and specified. What helped me the most in grading this student was his program purpose and function, through their response, it is very clear the difference between purpose and function. Also, it is clear how his list managed complexity, so that helped me understand more.
