Most of my scoring was the same as College Board, but on some categories I gave the student a point whereas College Board did not, such as the Managing Complexity row. The student missed the categories Program Purpose and Function and Managing Complexity. They did not include a correct program purpose, instead describing the function. When grading, I was hesitant on marking off the program purpose, so I will also have to work on differentiating program purpose and functionality. They included a list, however, it was not necessary for the program, so it did not manage complexity. I will have to work on knowing what lists are actually effective in managing complexity, as the student's did not, and I thought it did.

My scoring was the same as College Board, the student met all of the requirements. The written response was very detailed and concise, with all the requirements met and specified. What helped me the most in grading this student was his program purpose and function, through their response, it is very clear the difference between purpose and function. Also, it is clear how his list managed complexity, so that helped me understand more.

The student missed most of the requirements. I thought that the game itself was made very well, with great features and a great design, but the written response did not do it justice. The student explained everything in very vague and incorrect ways. It sounded like they did not know what they were talking about. So, I know that for my CPT I will have to be very knowledgeable about the code I made to be successful in making a good write-up.

My scoring was the same as College Board, the student met all of the requirements. The written response was very detailed and concise, with all the requirements met and specified. The video was also clear in functionality, and executed well. The students program was very simple but effective. This could act as a great reference for my future CB CPT.

For Row 1, I scored the student a 1 while College Board scored them a 0. The program purpose was not identified correctly, which I was surprised at. I thought that they identified it correctly, so I will work on identifying the difference between purpose and functionality more. This was another simple but effective project. However, the written response sort of felt like the student was meeting the bare minimum. It meets all the requirements, but it lacks detail in most if not all of the descriptions. This was a high-scored project, but I wouldn't use it as a reference.

The row that I scored differently than College Board was row 2. I thought that the list and code segments were specified correctly, but apparently the data stored in the list is not even used. Therefore, it doesn't contribute to the functionality of the program. I will have to learn how to read code better, to be able to tell how lists and data is truly being used. Besides this row, I scored all the same as College Board. I was able to tell if the list managed complexity, which is an improvement for me. I was also able to tell that the calls were not correctly specified. Still, from this response, I can tell that College Board is very harsh with what they expect from the CPTs.
