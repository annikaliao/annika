## Legal and Ethical Concerns

### License Types

**Open Source MIT License**
- Code is used freely
- Only **closed source** versions may be created and distributed
    - GH project could be private
- Author of software is credited (i.e. in comments)

**Open Source GPL License**
- Code is used freely
- NO distributing closed source versions
    - GH project must be public
- i.e. Linux and Ubuntu 
- i.e., Qualcomm keeps their code away from GPL to protect their patents

### Legal and Ethically 

- IMPORTANT to comply with terms of licenses and to cite sources
- Many of us do not legally and ethically handle media content, brekaing terms of license
- Open Source usage in CSP is educational use and ethical
- Individuals and companies are required to figure out techniques and business models in order to use Open Source software according to terms of license
- i.e., Red Hat used GPL license and gave away software for free, and this became their business model
- Open Source software is crucial to businesses!

### Reflection
 Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update.

Our group chose to use the MIT license. 

## Safe Computing

### Personal Identifiable Information (PII)

- All information posted is added to Searchable PII

| &#9989; | &#9745; | &#10060; |
| --- | --- | --- |
| - Name <br> - Email (junk email) <br> - Picture <br> - High school <br> - College <br> - Properties <br> - State/city (present and past) <br> - Credit reports | - Birth date <br> - Place of birth <br> - Address <br> - Phone number <br> - Maiden names of mother and grandma <br> - Driver license number | - Credentials for access <br> - Two-factor authentication (financial accounts) <br> - SSN <br> - Tax records |

### Security 

- Establish multi-factor authentication when possible, or biometrics
- **Malware** is sent in attachments, and puts viruses on your computer
- **Phishing** is unknown sources enticing you into responses
    - i.e. Amazon asking for login information
    - Check closely at email source/address
- **Symmetric encryption**: type of encryption where only one key (a secret key) is used to both encrypt and decrypt electronic information 
- **Assymetric cryptography** (public-key cryptography): process that uses a pair of related keys – one public key and one private key – to encrypt and decrypt a message and protect it from unauthorized access or use

### Reflection 

Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.

What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure?

Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.

Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.

Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment.

Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.
