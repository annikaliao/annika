## Our Project and Presentation

Our presentation was at 6:30 pm, and we were in classroom A151. We presented to Mr. Yeung our program, explained each of the functions, and how we contribtued to it. I am very proud of how our group did, and how hard we worked this whole trimester. I am also very proud of how our final project turned out. It has all the components that we planned before, and it works very well with no bugs. It's also meaningful and useful, and can actually be utilized. 

## Classes We Visited

After our presentation, me and my group toured the fine arts section. We looked at the work of AP Studio Art, 3D Animation, Ceramics, and Digital Media. Haeryn, one of our group members, had work displayed for AP Studio Art, so we were very enthusiastic about seeing that:

Here is some of the other art we viewed:

I really enjoyed seeing all the different forms and expressions of art. 

## Plans for Next Trimester

Next trimester, I plan to be more involved with the coding. This trimester, I was just starting out learning to code, so as I have learned a lot, and will continue to do so, I will try to code more next trimester. Maybe next trimester I will attempt to create a game. Games have so many components, and different things give different outcomes. Therefore, it will be a good challenge.
