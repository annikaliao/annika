title: 1.3 Program Design and Development

## 1.3 Daily Video 1
> Learning Objectives:
> - Develop a program using a development process
> - Design a program and its user interface

- Programs are developed with a specific purpose in mind
- Developers follows specific steps and stick to their plan
- The development may be more exploratory and the steps are dictated by what happens
    - i.e. early AI projects
- Program requirements describe how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide
- A program's specification defines the requirements for the program

### Development Process
1. Investigation/Reflection
- Determine the requirements of the program
- Understand the constraints
- Understand the user concerns and interests
- With surveys, user testing, interviews, direct observations, etc.
2. Design
- Brainstorming, by drawing on investigation
- Storyboarding the program
- Planning user experience
- Laying out user interface
- Organizing into modules
- Develop a testing strategy
- Decide on program requirements
3. Prototyping
- Of the program or components
- An incremental process is frequently used so developers can refine modules of the program 
4. Testing
- Test program every step of the way
- Testing occurs at micro level and macro level
5. Refine and revise

## 1.3 Daily Video 2
> Learning Objectives:
> - Acknowledge code segments used from other sources

- Programs are developed by teams of people, rarely solo
- Individuals/teams work on different functional components
- Each member deserves to receive credit for their work
- Their names must be written in the documentation of the program indicating their contributions
- Many projects use comments within the programming to give credit
- Developers need to be able to determine who can/should fix the problem when there is bug
- Developers may use code segments, procedures, algorithms, etc. from others
    - Must credit these individuals 
    - Considered intellectual property of the author
    - Author's name and source of code segments
    - Resembles a bibliography or a works cited in research paper

## 1.3 Daily Video 3
> Learning Objectives:
> - Describe the purpose of a code segment or program by writing documentation

- Program documentation is a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program, and how it was developed
- Comments are a form of program documentation written into the program to be read by people, and do not affect how a program runs
- Documentation happens throughout the development process
    - Beginning: list specifications
    - During: track process
    - After: explain overall process
- Program documentation helps effeciency of overall programming process, and programmers' ability to test and refine the program and response to bugs
- Improve developing or maintaining correct programs when working individually or in collaborative programming environments
- Not all programming environments support comments, so other methods of documentation may be required
