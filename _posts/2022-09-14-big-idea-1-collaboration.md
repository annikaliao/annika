## 1.1 Daily Video
> Objectives: 
> - Explain how computing innovations are improved through collaboration
> - Demonstrate effective interpersonal skills during collaboration

### Examples of Collaboration
- Facebook
- - Multiple departments get together to figure out what is best for the public
- - Effective collaboration produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity of talents and perspecties of those who designed it
- - A computing innovation can: (1) include a program as an integral part of its function, (2) be physical, nonphysical computing software, or a nonphysical computing concept
- Super Mario Brothers 2 vs. Super Mario Brothers 3
- - The results after collaboration and combined ideas were much improved overall
- - Collaboration that includes diverse perspectives helps avoid bias in the develoment of computing innovations

### Why Collaborate?
- To gain interpersonal skills such as: communication, consensus building, conflict resolution, and negotiation
- "If you want to go fast, go alone if you want to go far, go together." - African Proverb
- We will need to collaborate on projects in school, but there are times we will work alone. Even then, make sure to keep communicating with peers.

> - Explain how computing innovations are developed by groups of people

### How to Collaborate in Class
- Consulting with users is important to gather diverse perspectives and feedback!
- Pair Programming
    - Two programmers work together as a pair
    - The "driver" writes program code, the "observer, pointer, or navigator" reviews each line as it is typed in
    - Don't be a back-seat programmer! Just be the second pair of eyes
- Think-Pair-Share
    - Students think through a problem alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, then share results with the class
    - Keeps independence in thoughts about problem, collaborate different thoughts at end!
- Leave comments in code
    - Communicate to your group
    - Communicate to yourself
    - Acknowledge code segments used from other sources
    - Acknowledge media used from other sources
    - Differentiate what you and your group did
    - Clarify the functionality of your code
- Online tools: 
    - repl.it as a multiplayer resource
    - GitHub as collaboration in a repository
    - Shared document or folder
    - Ask for feedback!

## MCQ

## Underlying Thoughts From The MCQ
- Is my group setup strictly on the basis of current friends and common interests?
- - No. Although I have known and talked to Haeryn and Sophia previously, we have never really been great friends. I met Liav for the first time through our APCSP class. All of us do share some common interests in one form or another, but that is not the reason our group is formed this way. We have many different interests but we all truly bonded through our interest in computer science.
- Is my group setup with diversity in backgrounds, gender, and perspectives?
- - Yes. I am a Taiwanese female, Haeryn is a Korean female, Sophia is a Chinese female, and Liav is an Israeli male. So, there is a lot of diversity in our identities. As for perspectives, we all have different perspectives mostly due to our differing identities, however our perspectives do not clash, so we get along and collaborate well. 
- Is my group best equipped for the skill sets needed for success in classroom?
- - Yes. We all work hard and work well together, so there will be no lack of communication or anything along those lines. I believe our group will succeed and go above and beyond this trimester.
