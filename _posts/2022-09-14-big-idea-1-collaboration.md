- - Effective collaboration produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity of talents and perspecties of those who designed it

## MCQ

## Underlying Thoughts From The MCQ
- Is my group setup strictly on the basis of current friends and common interests?
- - No. Although I have known and talked to Haeryn and Sophia previously, we have never really been great friends. I met Liav for the first time through our APCSP class. All of us do share some common interests in one form or another, but that is not the reason our group is formed this way. We have many different interests but we all truly bonded through our interest in computer science.
- Is my group setup with diversity in backgrounds, gender, and perspectives?
- - Yes. I am a Taiwanese female, Haeryn is a Korean female, Sophia is a Chinese female, and Liav is an Israeli male. So, there is a lot of diversity in our identities. As for perspectives, we all have different perspectives mostly due to our differing identities, however our perspectives do not clash, so we get along and collaborate well. 
- Is my group best equipped for the skill sets needed for success in classroom?
- - Yes. We all work hard and work well together, so there will be no lack of communication or anything along those lines. I believe our group will succeed and go above and beyond this trimester.
