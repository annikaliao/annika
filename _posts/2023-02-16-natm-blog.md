## Our Project and Presentation

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/806618712056528906/1079992125103550545/FullSizeRender.jpg" width="75%" align="middle"></p>

We presented our project to several audience members throughout the night. We presented to Mr. Mortensen, as well as several other audience members, like Mr. Yeung, some friends, and some parents. We explained some of the features and let them interact with them, which was my favorite part, because I liked seeing the people have fun with the project that WE built!


## Other Presentations

After our presentation, me and my group toured some of the other CSP and CSA projects...

 ... as well as the fine arts section. We looked at the work of animation, ceramics, and digital media. We spotted a fellow CSP student's work!

I really enjoyed seeing all the different forms and expressions of art. 

## Reflection

I am happy with how our NATM presentation went, as we were able to present to a ton of audience, and every presentation, the audience looked engaged and impressed. Last trimester, I feel our presentation did not go very well, in terms of presenting to the audience, so I am glad this trimester, I improved. Our program to present was much improved compared to last trimester, as I was only just introduced to coding. My favorite part of the night was going around and seeing everyone elses projects that they've worked so hard on.
