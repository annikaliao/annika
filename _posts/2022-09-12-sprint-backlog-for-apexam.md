# How to Prepare for the APCSP Classroom

Throughout the year, we will be creating our Performance Task for College Board, which will be worth 30% of our grade on the AP exam. This will be due on the day of the AP exam, which is also when we will take the MCQ. 

## Performance Task
> My current outline for the performance task: [Outline](https://annikaliao.github.io/annika/jupyter/2022/09/11/creative-development-outline.html)

- I will review the past examples from College Board. Looking at both good and bad examples may inform me what to strive for and what to avoid in order to succeed.
- I will constantly be reviewing the instructions AND the scoring guidelines as I make progress to make sure I am meeting all the requirements.
- I will create a checklist of what I need to accomplish, making sure I have all the requirements, and making sure I do not fall behind.
- I will cite my sources. As I'm not very experienced in coding, I'm sure I will be taking inspiration from other code at some point, so I will make sure to give credit to the original creators.
- I will make comments in my code as I work. It is good to do this while I go instead of all at the end, because then I will know precisely what that section's purpose is

## AP Exam MCQ

- I will take notes every week in class on what I've learned and accomplished.
- I will watch the College Board and Khan Academy videos to learn and expand my knowledge on the topics.
- I will utilize the quizzes and practice tests to get the maximum amount of practice I can. I will also complete test corrections to learn how to correct my mistakes. I will time my practice tests to help with my work pacing.
