## Reflection and Insights

I found the panel very helpful and interesting. The speakers, John and Ashley, Cal State San Marcos graduates, explored several aspects of their college and programs in regards to STEM. They explained very in-depth some programs and research that is offered at CSUSM, and provided resources and advice to take part and succeed in these programs. I will take their advice, in my STEM journey. I found it inspiring that Ashley shared her personal experience of failing several of her STEM classes, but relentlessly worked hard towards her dream in a STEM career regardless: "Failure does not define you". Also, the activity at the end was very fun and engaging. Overall, I think I was benefited by this panel highly, with new resources, knowledge, and insights into STEM in college.
