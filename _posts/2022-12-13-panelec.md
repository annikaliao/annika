## Reflection

I want to continue to pursue computer science, but I know that if it doesn't end up being for me, it's ok. The skills I learn doing computer science can be valuable in many other careers, as Kathyleen Beveridge mentioned, and is currently experiencing. Learning computer science is all about being adaptable and learning critical thinking, and this is the best type of employee in any sort of workplace, so I will work on these skills.
