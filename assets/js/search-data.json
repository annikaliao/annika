Code is used freely | Only closed source versions may be created and distributed GH project could be private | . | Author of software is credited (i.e. in comments) | . Open Source GPL License . Code is used freely | NO distributing closed source versions GH project must be public | . | i.e. Linux and Ubuntu | i.e., Qualcomm keeps their code away from GPL to protect their patents | . Legal and Ethically . IMPORTANT to comply with terms of licenses and to cite sources | Many of us do not legally and ethically handle media content, brekaing terms of license | Open Source usage in CSP is educational use and ethical | Individuals and companies are required to figure out techniques and business models in order to use Open Source software according to terms of license | i.e., Red Hat used GPL license and gave away software for free, and this became their business model | Open Source software is crucial to businesses! | . Reflection . Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update. . Our group chose to use the MIT license. This makes code more accessable and distributable, which can be beneficial to other users, as it is more flexible. . Safe Computing . Personal Identifiable Information (PII) . All information posted is added to Searchable PII | . ✅ ☑ ❌ . - Name - Email (junk email) - Picture - High school - College - Properties - State/city (present and past) - Credit reports | - Birth date - Place of birth - Address - Phone number - Maiden names of mother and grandma - Driver license number | - Credentials for access - Two-factor authentication (financial accounts) - SSN - Tax records | . Security . Establish multi-factor authentication when possible, or biometrics | Malware is sent in attachments, and puts viruses on your computer | Phishing is unknown sources enticing you into responses i.e. Amazon asking for login information | Check closely at email source/address | . | Symmetric encryption: type of encryption where only one key (a secret key) is used to both encrypt and decrypt electronic information | Assymetric cryptography (public-key cryptography): process that uses a pair of related keys – one public key and one private key – to encrypt and decrypt a message and protect it from unauthorized access or use | . Reflection . Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles. The public and private keys on our repositories for APCSP is an example of assymmetric cryptography and PII. . What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure? I think PIIs are essential in user experience. However, the information in these PIIs MUST be kept secure, so that your site is safe and able to be utilized. This makes PII have a sort of dangerous aspect, as if leaked, it could cause identity theft, stolen information, etc. . Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication. A good password includes several types of characters, such as letters, numbers, and symbols. For example: A*f34?. A bad password includes only a couple or even one type of character, or has an easily guessed pattern. For example, abc123. . Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption is the process where only one key is used to both encrypt and decript data, whereas assymmetric encryption is the process in which two keys are used, one public to encrypt, and one private to decrypt. Symmetric is more efficient but assymmetric is much more secure. . Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment. AES-256 is the technology used to encrypt data in AWS deployment. . Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques. An example of phishing from firsthand experience is years ago on Instagram. Someone that “knew” DM’ed me, basically saying that this link puts together a collage of pictures of both our accounts. I clicked the link, and there was a normal looking sign in page. For some reason, I didn’t find anything suspiscious about this, and entered my login information. This led to the person behind that account hacking to take my information and log in to my Instagram account, and send that same link to many others in my following list. Now I know to never click on suspicious links, even if it looks professional. Some phishing techinques are attachments sent through emails, an unknown site asking for your log in information, or anything sent from accounts pretending to be a site or service you may use. .",

The data says that Facebook has an older, millenial audience, versus Tiktok with a younger, teenage audience. There is no purposeful exclusion, because there is no limited access, it is the user’s choice which platform to use, different generations are just attracted to different platforms. Businesses could benefit from having a wider age range audience, however it is not harmful and doesn’t need to be corrected, as there are no actual harmful effects in having a skewed audience. . Why do virtual assistants have female voices? . i.e. Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri. . Women are seen as gentler, and society has given women the role of assisting others. Women’s voices tend to be more articulate and clear, better for users. It’s not entirely harmful, but could be corrected, as it sort of enforces gender stereotypes. This can be corrected by giving the user the option to choose what kind of voice they want to hear. . Algorithm that influences your decisions: . Social media apps give users recommended videos, based on their browsing habits. They track what content you are more attracted to, then feeding you their content based on these likes. This causes you to be involuntarily more drawn to that company’s products and content, as you see a lot of it and its positive, advertised side. . HP Computers are Racist . The face-tracking feature on the black person’s computer does not work on him, but it does work on his friend, White Wanda. . Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? . Yes, the owner thinks that the computer is intentionally not tracking his face because he is black. . How do you think this happened? . The computer is unable to track his face because it doesn’t recognize his skin color as a user. The company probably only tested their face tracking feature on white people, so they were not aware or didn’t care that the face tracker might not work on other skin colors. . Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude? . It is harmful, but it probably was not intended to be. It prohibits black or darker skinned people from using their products. It was probably just a design and testing error, but it still ended up being harmful. . Should it be corrected? . Yes, it should be corrected so everyone can utilize their products, and not discirminated because of their skin tone. . What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome? . I would make the camera and program more sensitive to every skin tone, and test it on all sorts of skin tones before pushing it out to an audience. . Crowdsourcing . Crowdsourcing provides the ability to obtain shared information, share information, and participate in distributed computing. . Reduce computer bias | Reach beyond community | . Evidence of Crowdsourcing . Hacks . Our Project . We can add a forum where women can discuss their own personal remedies to their periods, because medical diagnosed remedies may not actually be useful to everyone, but learning about other people’s personal experience and methods may let the user find which one is right for them. . Our Enviroment . CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? . Slack is sort of a crowdsource resource in our CSP enviroment, as we share problems and solutions with our peers. We can initiate a site, just for posting general solutions and ideas for CSP. .",

            "content": "Feature Description . My feature is a period cycle tracker. . Program Purpose and Function . The program can help women track periods, for health and education. This period cycle tracker allows users to submit the information of their last period, including date and length, and the program will use the data to display the date of their next period on a calender. The input is the dates and numbers inputted by the user, and the output is the date of their next period, as well it visually displayed on a calender. . Code Plan . according to CB requirements . Data Abstraction . I will use data abstraction in storing the user input. The date, length of period, and lenth of cycle will all be stored in a JavaScript object. This way, the different types of data can all be compiled together, to make the program’s data easier to access when calculating dates for every month. . Managing Complexity . I would have to create new sets of variables and functions for each month of the year in order to display each period cycle. By keeping the user’s data all in an object, each time the calculation runs for a month’s output, it will just access the data in the object, instead of the function being written several times. . Procedural Abstraction . My procedure will take the data from the object and calculate and produce the date of the next period. The parameters will be date and length. This procedure is what creates the output. . Algorithm Implementation . With this output (sequencing), the program can use this new produced date to run again (iteration) to produce the following month’s period. The default is to output 6 months of periods, but if the user chooses to display more, or less, then it will output a different output, which is more or less months (selection). . Testing . The first call will be the user input of January 4th, 5 days, and 28 days. 28 days will be added to January 1st to produce the next period start and 5 days will be added to this date to calculate period end. Result will be that the periods will last from February 1st to 6th, March 1st to 6th, and March 29th to April 3rd. The second call will be the user input of January 4th, 5 days, and 28 days, and to display 6 months instead of 3. 28 days will be added to January 1st to produce the next period start and 5 days will be added to this date to calculate period end. Result will be that the periods will last from February 1st to 6th, March 1st to 6th, March 29th to April 3rd, April 26th to May 1st, May 24th to May 29th, and June 26 to July 1st. . Video Plan . I will input the date January 4th into date of last period, 5 days into length of last period, and 28 days into usual menstrual cycle. Program will output that the periods will last from February 1st to 6th, March 1st to 6th, and March 29th to April 3rd. .",

The expression less than or equal to does not require the value to be both less than and equal to to be true. This is also mathematically impossible. NOT num &lt; 15 means that num has to be either greater than or equal to 15. I am not sure why I chose the answer I did, but I will not make that mistake again. . Q16 . Summing the even numbers in a list . . The algorithm needs to choose whether or not the integer is even, so it is going through selection. Sequencing is when the algorithm runs in order, and the original program already does this, as it is computing a sum of several values. . Q39 . Robot in maze procedure MoveAndTurn . . With the numTurns parameter, I did not think about the fact that the robot can only move right. I saw that the robot was facing forward, and only needed to turn left to reach the pathway, so the answer I put was the robot only turning once.

Most of my scoring was the same as College Board, but on some categories I gave the student a point whereas College Board did not, such as the Managing Complexity row. The student missed the categories Program Purpose and Function and Managing Complexity. They did not include a correct program purpose, instead describing the function. When grading, I was hesitant on marking off the program purpose, so I will also have to work on differentiating program purpose and functionality. They included a list, however, it was not necessary for the program, so it did not manage complexity. I will have to work on knowing what lists are actually effective in managing complexity, as the student’s did not, and I thought it did. . Submission 2 . Video Written Response College Board Scoring . My scoring was the same as College Board, the student met all of the requirements. The written response was very detailed and concise, with all the requirements met and specified. What helped me the most in grading this student was his program purpose and function, through their response, it is very clear the difference between purpose and function. Also, it is clear how his list managed complexity, so that helped me understand more. . Performance Task Scoring 2 . Submission 1 . Video Written Response College Board Scoring . The student missed most of the requirements. I thought that the game itself was made very well, with great features and a great design, but the written response did not do it justice. The student explained everything in very vague and incorrect ways. It sounded like they did not know what they were talking about. So, I know that for my CPT I will have to be very knowledgeable about the code I made to be successful in making a good write-up. . Submission 2 . Video Written Response College Board Scoring . My scoring was the same as College Board, the student met all of the requirements. The written response was very detailed and concise, with all the requirements met and specified. The video was also clear in functionality, and executed well. The students program was very simple but effective. This could act as a great reference for my future CB CPT. . Submission 3 . Video Written Response College Board Scoring . For Row 1, I scored the student a 1 while College Board scored them a 0. The program purpose was not identified correctly, which I was surprised at. I thought that they identified it correctly, so I will work on identifying the difference between purpose and functionality more. This was another simple but effective project. However, the written response sort of felt like the student was meeting the bare minimum. It meets all the requirements, but it lacks detail in most if not all of the descriptions. This was a high-scored project, but I wouldn’t use it as a reference. . Submission 4 . Video Written Response College Board Scoring . The row that I scored differently than College Board was row 2. I thought that the list and code segments were specified correctly, but apparently the data stored in the list is not even used. Therefore, it doesn’t contribute to the functionality of the program. I will have to learn how to read code better, to be able to tell how lists and data is truly being used. Besides this row, I scored all the same as College Board. I was able to tell if the list managed complexity, which is an improvement for me. I was also able to tell that the calls were not correctly specified. Still, from this response, I can tell that College Board is very harsh with what they expect from the CPTs. . Performance Task Scoring 3 . Submission 1 . Video Written Response College Board Scoring . I gave a 5/6 and College Board gave a 3/6. I incorrectly gave the student points for Row 3 (Managing Complexity) and Row 4 (Procedural Abtraction). I thought that the list described managed complexity, but CB says that the results of the program would have been just as easy to develop or maintain without the list. I thought that the student correctly described the procedure, but CB says that the response does not contribute to the overall program. I will work on determining what is and isn’t a good list for a program. I thought that this program was a little bit too simple in terms of functionality as well as code. . Submission 2 . Video Written Response College Board Scoring . I thought that this project was very cool and detailed. Both College Board and I scored this student with a full score. All requirements are met, clear, and specified. The functionality works very well, and the code and written response are both very in detail. This project could be a good reference for my own CPT. . Submission 3 . Video Written Response College Board Scoring . My score matched College Board’s with a 1/6. I think that the program itself is a good idea and detailed, but the written response was not. The written response was vague and specified a lot of the wrong things, or nothing at all. I still checked more boxes than CB though, such as in Row 4, I did not notice that the procedure did not include a parameter, so I checked that box off. And in Row 6, College Board says results were not specified correctly, but I thought they were, so I will work on correctly identifying calls and results. . Submission 4 . Video Written Response College Board Scoring . I thought that this project was so cute and creative, and pretty well done. I scored it a 6/6 and College Board scored it a 5/6. The only thing this student got wrong, and also what I graded wrong, was Row 6. They incorrectlly described calls. The student describes code segments rather than input and output.

Collatz: Asks whether repeating two arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1 the Collatz conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in math | . | Hailstone numbers: Sequence of integers generated by Collatz conjecture | Iteration: Action or process of iterating or repeating Procedure in which repitition of a sequence of operations yields results successively closer to a desired result | . | Undecidable problems: Problem that hsould give a yes or no answer, but no algorithm exists that can answer correctly on all inputs yet | Unsolvable problems: Problem which no algorithm can be written to find the solution | Algorithm efficiency: aspect of algorithmic programming that measures amount of steps needed to solve a problem | . Hacks . Hack #1 . Take the two codes above and combine them so one imput gives the output that contains both the hailstone numbers and the number of iterations it takes i = 1. The more efficient the code, the higher your grade will be. (Algorithm Efficency) (.25) . i = int(input(&quot;Enter a number&quot;)) print(&quot;Number:&quot;, i) def collatz(i): while i &gt; 1: print(i, end=&#39; &#39;) if (i % 2): i = 3*i + 1 list_.append(i) else: i = i//2 list_.append(i) print(1, end=&#39;&#39;) list_ = [i] l = list(i) print(&#39;Number of iterations:&#39;, len(l) - 1) print(&#39;Sequence: &#39;) collatz(i) .

The first one is an inefficient way to add the sums of variables, because it individually assigns and adds each variable. The second one is more efficient because it uses a list to assign values, and finds the sum with a sum() function. . Hack #3 . Explain algorithm efficiency in your own words (.25) . Algorithm Efficiency: making an algorithm more effective by using less lines of code and more resources . Hack #4 . Code an efficient program that shows your daily tasks or schedule.

            "content": "Notes . simulation: a simulation is an imitation of a situation or process i.e., testing cars, games, train routes, etc. | Advantages safer | cost-efficient | time-efficient | . | Disadvantages not as accurate | outside factors not included | . | . | experiment: procedure undertaken to make a discovery, test a hypothesis, or demonstrate a known fact | do NOT use simulation when: data is already set and cannot change i.e. score, statistics | . | . | Class simulation vs code: Mr. Mortensen = random.randint | if statement = if player is out | else = safe | while loop = repeat process until winner | . | . Hacks . Hack #1 . Rock Paper Scissors Simulation . You are Player A. You can input whether you want to shoot rock, paper or scissors. At random, either rock, paper, or scissors, will be assigned to Player B. If the two players&#39; values are equal, then they will both receive a point. If one player gets rock and the other paper, paper will win, and that player will receive a point. This will also apply to scissors beating paper and rock beating scissors. The first player to receive 3 points wins the game, and the simulation stops. . Hack #2 . Hack #3 . The rolling dice simulator asks the user to choose an amount of dice to roll (1 through 6). Then, once there is an input, the simulator outputs dice rolls (a value 1 through 6), the number of times chosen by the user. For example, I chose 2 dice, and I received the values 6 and 1. This simulates the dice rolls I would roll on 2 dice in real life. . Hack #4 . def parse_input(input_string): if input_string.strip() in {&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;,&quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;}: return int(input_string) else: print(&quot;Please enter a number from 1 to 6.&quot;) raise SystemExit(1) import random def roll_dice(num_dice): roll_results = [] for _ in range(num_dice): roll = random.randint(1, 10) roll_results.append(roll) return roll_results def sumOfList(list, size): if (size == 0): return 0 else: return list[size - 1] + sumOfList(list, size - 1) num_dice_input = input(&quot;How many dice do you want to roll? [1-6] &quot;) num_dice = parse_input(num_dice_input) roll_results = roll_dice(num_dice) total = sumOfList(roll_results, len(roll_results)) print(&quot;you rolled:&quot;, roll_results) print(&quot;sum:&quot;, total) . you rolled: [1, 9, 6, 10] sum: 26 . I modified the dice into a 10 sided dice, then I added a function that adds all the dice roll values together. Now the code outputs both the list of values rolled for the amount of dice inputted, as well as its sum. . Extra . import random round = 1 a = 0 b = 0 for a in range(0, 3) or b in range(0, 4): print(&quot; nRound&quot;, round) throwA = input(&quot;Would you like to throw rock, paper, or scissors?&quot;) print(&quot;You:&quot;, throwA) throws = [&#39;rock&#39;, &#39;paper&#39;, &#39;scissors&#39;] throwB = random.choice(throws) print(&quot;Annika:&quot;, throwB) if throwA == throwB: a += 1 b += 1 print(&quot;Tie, you both selected &quot; + throwA + &quot;. You both receive a point.&quot;) elif throwA == &quot;rock&quot;: if throwB == &quot;scissors&quot;: a += 1 print(&quot;Rock smashes scissors!&quot;) else: b += 1 print(&quot;Paper covers rock!&quot;) elif throwA == &quot;paper&quot;: if throwB == &quot;rock&quot;: a += 1 print(&quot;Paper covers rock!&quot;) else: b += 1 print(&quot;Scissors cuts paper!&quot;) elif throwA == &quot;scissors&quot;: if throwB == &quot;paper&quot;: a += 1 print(&quot;Scissors cuts paper!&quot;) else: b += 1 print(&quot;Rock smashes scissors!&quot;) print(&quot; nYour score:&quot;, a) print(&quot;Annika&#39;s score:&quot;, b) round +=1 print(&quot;Game over!&quot;) . Round 1 You: rock Annika: scissors Rock smashes scissors! Your score: 1 Annika&#39;s score: 0 Round 2 You: paper Annika: rock Paper covers rock! Your score: 2 Annika&#39;s score: 0 Round 3 You: scissors Annika: paper Scissors cuts paper! Your score: 3 Annika&#39;s score: 0 Game over! . I coded the simulation that I had described in Hack 1. I coded a rock paper scissors game where you are playing against a computer with randomized outputs. The first one to score 3 points wins! You score a point when your throw beats the computer. Rock wins scissors, paper wins rock, and scissors wins paper. If tied, you both score a point. This may not be authentic to a real life experiment, because the machine doesn&#39;t take in outside factors, such as the other player&#39;s strategies. They could throw late, allowing them to see you you throw before throwing themselves. .",

Today we will be looking at algorithms from another standpoint. Q: How many ways are there to peel a banana? Is the result the same? . Main Idea 1: Algorithms can be written in different ways and still do the same thing . However, Algorithms that look similar might not always have the same result | Different algorithms can be used to solve the same problem | . Examples! . The goal with the two algorithms below is to show &quot;Wow! Good job!&quot; when you get an A and show &quot;Nice!&quot; when you get a B or C (pass), if you don&#39;t pass (lower than 70) it will show &quot;Do Better&quot; . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) if grade &gt;= 90: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) if 70 &lt;= grade &lt; 90: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif grade &lt; 70: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . Yay! it worked! Lets look at the next one. Do you notice any differences? Do you think this algorithm will still achieve the same goal? If not, what is the flaw? . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) if grade &gt;= 90: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) elif 70 &lt; grade &lt; 90: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif grade &lt; 70: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . So, why is this important? Why are we even doing this? . When 2 algorithms look extremely similar, it is easy to assume they do the same thing. However, that is not the case and we have learn how to notice small differences in code and pretty much debug. . just know that codes that look similar don&#39;t always produce the same things :) | . Real-life situation (Storytime) . Tommy and Billy are working on solving the same issue with an algorithm Tommy creates a functioning code and yells &quot;I did it!&quot; He looks over at his friend Billy which is having a bit of trouble and he offers help However, Billy&#39;s code looks basically the same! which confuses them Then they remeber that they were taught that algorithms that look similar don&#39;t always have the same results and they collaborate to do further investigation:) . Now, without running, investigate the algorithm below. This one looks different. Do you thing it will still achieve the same goal as above? . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) A = grade &gt;= 90 B = 70 &lt;= grade &lt; 90 C = grade &lt; 70 if A: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) elif B: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif C: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . Why is this important? When collaborating or working on group projects, two people might come up with two different ways to solve a problem, and that happens a lot. . know that same goal can be achieved in many ways (the possibilities are endless) | make notes in you code! (explain how it works to others or you future self) | . How to write Nested Conditionals as Boolean expressions . the following 2 pieces of code is supposed to print &quot;don&#39;t go to school&quot; unless: . it is a weekday | it is a holiday | . isHoliday = False isWeekday = True #if holiday, dont go to school if isHoliday == True: print(&quot;don&#39;t go to school!&quot;) # otherwise, if it is a weekday, go to school else: if isWeekday == True: print(&quot;go to school!&quot;) # but if it is neither a weekday or holiday, don&#39;t go to school else: print(&quot;don&#39;t go to school&quot;) . isHoliday = False isWeekday = True # setting variables here (same as above to make comparison easier) driveSchool = not(isHoliday) and isWeekday if driveSchool == False: print(&quot;don&#39;t go to school!&quot;) if driveSchool == True: print(&quot;go to school!&quot;) # now we can make a regular conditional/ if statement without having a nested conditional .

Developing Algorithms . When creating an algorithm, its good to outline its process before coding This ensures that it is sequenced correctly | . | You should represent the algorithm using a flowchart or natural language Visualization can help you better see the flow of the whole algorithm | This may allow for the coding process to be more efficient and effective | . | . Review of Selection and Iteration . Algorithms with iteration repeat a function until a goal is reached To more easily represent an algorithm without showing all the repeated steps, we can use iteration | . | Algorithms with selection only go through certain functions if certain things are true or false | . Example 1 . Start | The number of pretzels in the pack is 6 | Eat one fruit snack, number of pretzels in pack goes down by 1 | How many pretzels are left? | Repeat step 3 until number of pretzels is 0 | Display that pack is empty | Finish | pretzel = 6 while (pretzel &gt; 0): pretzel -= 1 print(pretzel) if pretzel == 0: print(&quot;All done!&quot;) . Example 2 . The parking rate for a garage is as follows: Less than one hour: Free 1-2 hours: $5 &lt;br&gt; 2-3 hours: $8 3-4 hours: $10 &lt;br&gt; 4+ hours: $12 . . Start | Input number of hours parked | If hours is less than 1, cost is free | If hours is between 1 and 2, cost is $5 | If hours is between 2 and 3, cost is $8 | If hours is between 3 and 4, cost is $10 | If hours is more than 4, cost is $12 | Display cost and goodbye | Finish | print(&quot;The parking rate is as follows: n Less than one hour: Free n 1-2 hours: $5 n 2-3 hours: $8 n 3-4 hours: $10 n 4+ hours: $12&quot;) time = float(input(&quot;How many hours have you parked at this garage?&quot;)) print(&quot;How many hours have you parked at this garage?&quot;) print(time, &quot;hours costs:&quot;) if time &lt; 1 : print(&quot;Free&quot;) elif time &gt;= 1 and time &lt; 2 : print(&quot;$5&quot;) elif time &gt;= 2 and time &lt; 3 : print(&quot;$8&quot;) elif time &gt;= 3 and time &lt; 4 : print(&quot;$10&quot;) else: print(&quot;$12&quot;) print(&quot;Have a good day!&quot;) . Hacks . Develop your own complex algorithm using a flowchart and natural language, then code it! . Requirements: . Includes both a flowchart AND natural language | Working code of the same algorithm | Incorporates selection AND/OR iteration | Make it creative! | . Tips: . This site is good for making flowcharts! | Natural language should just be a list | Think about the whole process, not just the end result | .

Main Idea . Knowing existing algorithms can help construct new ones | simple existing algorithms can include determining min or max of two or more numbers | computing the sum or average | identifying if an integer is even or odd | . | Using existing correct algorithms can help as building blocks to reduce development time, testing, and identification of errors | . Create an algorithm that will start with any positive integer n and display the full sequence of numbers that result from following the Collatz Conjecture. . Example: 6 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 10 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 16 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1 . What does this function do? . if (n MOD 2 = 0) { display(&quot;n is even&quot;) } else { display(&quot;n is odd&quot;) } . By modifying the preexisting code, we can write create new code that follows th Collatz Conjecture. . DISPLAY (&quot;Choose a value for n&quot;) n &lt;- INPUT () REPEAT UNTIL (n = 1) { IF (n MOD 2 = 0 ) { n &lt;- n/2 } ELSE { n &lt;- n * 3 + 1 } . Hacks . Fix the number guessing game .

In your own words, briefly explain by writing down what an assignment operator is An assignment operator is a symbol used to store a value inside a variable, such as an equal sign (=). | . | In Collegeboard pseudocode, what symbol is used to assign values to variables? An arrow symbol (&lt;--). | . | A variable, x, is initially given a value of 15. Later on, the value for x is changed to 22. If you print x, would the command display 15 or 22? 22, because it comes after and therefore replaces it. | . | #3 Questions . What is a list? A list is a sequence of elements, each of which is a variable. | . | What is an element? An element is a single fragment of the code. | . | What is an easy way to reference the elements in a list or string?

My answer: A) The code segment iterates through myList, comparing each element to all other elements in the list. Answer: B) The code segment iterates through myList, comparing each element to all subsequent elements in the list. . I could tell that there is iteration, but I didn’t consider that it would need to be in subsequent order. To be truly honest, I didn’t know what subsequent meant, so I didn’t consider this factor. The algorithm traverses myList using two nested loops. The outer loop iterates from the first element in the list to the second-to-last element in the list. For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop compares that element to every subsequent element in the array. . Q13 . Test cases for allPositive in a list . . My answer: B) [-2, -1, 0] Answer: C) [-1, 0, 1] . I got confused with the 0 in the answer; 0 is not a positive number. The procedure traverses this list and eventually encounters the positive value 1. At this point, the procedure returns true when it should return false because the list does not contain only positive values. .",

How do programs receive input? . “Events” are triggered by some action, which usually sends input to the program i.e. mouse clicks, screen-taps, button clicks, keyboard entries, audio triggers | . | Input can come from a user or other programs | . What does input accomplish in a program? . Input usually affects the output | Program outputs are any data sent from a program to a device | Outputs produced by devices: visual, audio, tectile, text | . How does a program know what to do upon an event? . In event-driven programming, program statements are executed when triggered, rather than through the sequential flow of control | An action triggers an event Action may be initiated by the user or another program/device | . | The program “jumps” to the code segment according to the event The code segment is executed | Output is triggered by the code segment (or additional events) | . | The program code is not necessarily executed in order Code segments are executed as they are called according to the events triggered | . | Program output is usually based on a program’s input or prior state i.e. internal values | . | . 1.2 Daily Video 3 . Learning Objectives: . Explain how a program or code segment functions | . What is a program? . A program is a collection of statements that performs a specific task when run by a computer A statement is a single command | A group of statements part of a program is called a code segment | Code segments are executed according to the rules of the programming language | A program is often referred to as software | . | The behavior of a program is how a program functions during execution and is often descirbed by how a user interacts with it | . Program Function . A program needs to work for a variety of inputs and situations Code segment would need to work for a variety of lists | Code segment could be inserted into a larger program | . | A program can be described broadly by what it does, or in more detail by both what the program does and how the program statements accomplish this function | Description should: state the function simply so someone could use the code segment in a larger program | include how it functions by explaining in detail how the code segment functions | . | . MCQ . . Our Team’s Final Project . Do we have final project ideas for a PBL Web Project? Yes, our team is planning to create a productive planner with many different uses. | . | Are we considering a project that is best for our educational purpose? Yes, most of us have minimal coding experience, so by creating a not too complicated but still useful application, we will all learn a lot. We can even utilize the application ourselves after it is complete. | . | Is the project going to hold team members interest for 8 weeks? Yes, there are many different elements to incorporate into this project. Even if we somehow complete our original plan, there is big capacity for new other elements to be implemented. | . | Does the project have potential for someone to use it beyond the 8 weeks? ie Customer or Sponsor needed? Yes, this application is very useful and can be utilized by anyone. A planner is something everyone needs, we are just making it even more convenient and useful. | . | Does the project have potential to be used for Create Performance Task submission? Yes, in our project there are many ways to implement code that includes sequencing, selection and iteration, procedures and lists, etc. in a functionable and creative way | . | .",

I shared a few words of gratitude to my sister, Naomi. She is moving to Irvine for college tomorrow, and after the video, I thought there is no better time than now to share my gratitude. Naomi and I are not usually sentimental with each other, so I thought it’d be awkward, but she listened with a kind demeanor. I told her how grateful I am for her and what she does for me and others, and that I will miss her an impossible much when she goes back to college. She responded with kind words as well, she told me how grateful she is for me, and that she will miss me too. I do think this experience has increased my well-being, even if just a little. . Gratitude List .

Goals . Sleep at least 6 hours a night Recently, I haven’t had the best sleeping habits, but I haven’t made that much of an effort to fix it. I know these habits are wrong, and I know that I will have to commit and take charge of the issue for something to happen. | . | Change up my workload schedule I also do not have the best habits in doing homework and studying, so I will need to put that into work.

Is my group setup strictly on the basis of current friends and common interests? | No. Although I have known and talked to Haeryn and Sophia previously, we have never really been great friends. I met Liav for the first time through our APCSP class. All of us do share some common interests in one form or another, but that is not the reason our group is formed this way. We have many different interests but we all truly bonded through our interest in computer science. | . | Is my group setup with diversity in backgrounds, gender, and perspectives? | Yes. I am a Taiwanese female, Haeryn is a Korean female, Sophia is a Chinese female, and Liav is an Israeli male. So, there is a lot of diversity in our identities. As for perspectives, we all have different perspectives mostly due to our differing identities, however our perspectives do not clash, so we get along and collaborate well. | . | Is my group best equipped for the skill sets needed for success in classroom? | Yes.

            "content": "Idea 1: Song Snippet Game . Performance Task Outline . My first idea was to create a quiz-type game, where the questions each play a snippet of a song (5-10 seconds), and the user is to guess as many songs as possible before the timer runs out. I want to be able to link Spotify to the site, so that the song selections are personalized for each user, but if that is not possible, the song selection will be a pre-curated playlist of current top songs. The more songs you guess correct, the higher your score, which you will be able to compare with others through a leaderboard. Also, the faster you guess a song, the more points you will be rewarded. . College Board Requirements . Program Purpose and Function . The purpose of this program is entertainment, to test the user&#39;s knowledge on their own favorite songs, as well as current trending songs. After playing the song snippet, the user will input their guess on the song, and the output will be the user&#39;s score at the end of the quiz. . Data Abstraction . The data will be the user&#39;s guesses, collected at each question and in lists. Once the timer runs out, the data will be added together to provide the output, which is the score. The data will also be stored in a database to compare to other scores in the leaderboard. Also, there will be data collected from the user&#39;s personal Spotify account in order to create the personalized song snippets. . Managing Complexity . The amount of points rewarded will be different depending on how quick the user answers the question, and there is not specifically a set number of questions, the user will be given questions as long as the timer is ticking. The song snippets in each question will be provided from the user&#39;s own Spotify account, making the quiz much more complex. . Procedural Abstraction . The procedure is collecting data from the user&#39;s personal Spotify account, called song abstraction. This procedure creates an overall personalized quiz and experience for each user. . Algorithm Implementation . The main algorithm is collecting the answers that the user inputs into the quiz and giving the score, but collecting the song snippets to form questions will also be an algorithm. The sequence will be collection of data from the user&#39;s Spotify, then the generation of questions, then the user will complete the quiz, with the output score at the end. The selection will the user&#39;s choice in answer, which will be translated to a specific amount of points. The iteration will be the songs, and the points provided per questions according to the timer. . Testing . For the testing, I will record a video of me completing the quiz myself, and upon receiving the score, I will compare it to the other scores in the leaderboard. . Learning Preparation . Before beginning on this project, I will need to learn more about databases, algorithms, and iteration in data collection. I will also have to explore a lot to figure out how to incorporate the Spotify Web API into my project&#39;s software. . Additional Ideas . These ideas are some other concpets I may want to explore if Idea 1 is not right for me. . Personalized Playlist:- The user can either input their favorite artists and songs, or the system will automatically collect their data. Then, a personalized playlist of songs based off their collective music taste will be created. The user can also select the &quot;vibe&quot; of the playlist, such as upbeat or moody, and the playlist will be curated toward that. | Daily Diet: The user may check off their allergies or dietary restrictions, and this site will provide them with a list of recipes or dish inspiration to meet those restrictions. | . | .",

            "title": "Spider-Man Quiz (App Lab)",
            "content": ". Brainstorming Process . For my quiz, I wanted to choose a topic that I liked and was familiar with. At first, I wanted to do a quiz about music, but I thought that the questions may be too exclusive, as music is more self-expressive concept, so the quiz may not be enjoyable for everyone. I started thinking about what topics may have set material that could make for interesting questions. This led me to think more about trivia-based questions. As a character with an ingrained backstory and history, Spider-Man would make great trivia questions. Yes, Spider-Man-themed questions may be just as exclusive as music-themed questions, but the answers are set in stone, and not up to interpretation. . So, I went with a Spider-Man themed quiz. . Planning Process . First, I planned out how my quiz was going to run. How many questions it would have, how many answers for each question, how it would signify a correct or wrong answer. I also really wanted to include a point system. I decided to keep it simple with 3 questions and 4 answers just like the example quiz. I wanted to either have a pop-up or a different screen as a way to know if you got the questions right. . Then, I brainstormed potential questions I could include. I searched up Spider-Man trivia on Google as for inspiration as well. The questions needed to be simple and multiple choice based, with answers not too obvious, but not super tricky either. With Spider-Man having so many different adaptions, it was difficult to think of questions that wouldn’t contradict information of each the version. The very original comic version is very universal, so I based my questions off that. . Once I got all my questions, I envisioned the design of my quiz. How could I make it the most practical and user-friendly? I wanted a simple design with fun colors, but not distracting and flashy. I wanted images that contributed to the Spider-Man theme. For the correct and wrong screens, I took inspiration from the quiz site Kahoot, because it’s straightforward yet effective. To incorporate the point system, I wanted a scoreboard at the end of my quiz. . With all of these elements planned out, I was ready to start building my quiz. . Building Process . To start off and learn how to make the quiz work, I followed the code of the example. I created different screens for each question, as well as the start and end page. Then, I used buttons and OnEvent -&gt; function to make the quiz run as it’s supposed to. The questions are displayed and the top, the answer boxes are the buttons. By clicking the start button you’re led to the first question, by clicking the correct answer button you’re led to the “correct screen”, if you click the wrong answer button you’re led to the “wrong screen”, then the next question, and so on and so forth. . . To add a scoreboard at the end, I created a variable called “score” and set it to zero. To make the system add up points, for every time the user is navigated to the “correct page”, a point is added onto the score variable. If the user is navigated to the “wrong page”, then no points are added. On the end page, there is a display of text saying what you scored, using the data the score variable has collected. . . Result . My quiz includes a start screen, 3 questions screens, a screen to signify a correct answer as well as a separate screen to signify a wrong answer, and an end page. Specific buttons lead to the desired screens, for example, clicking the correct answer will send you to the correct page, which will have a button guiding you to the next question. For every correct answer, a point is tallied, and the total score is displayed on the end screen. . Play my quiz! .",

InfoDb = [] # InfoDB is a data structure with expected Keys and Values # Append to List a Dictionary of key/values related to a person and cars InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Annika&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Liao&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;April 26&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;liao.92127@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;N/A&quot;] }) # Append to List a 2nd Dictionary of key/values InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Lyndsey&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Couch&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;March 29&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;Hyden&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;lyndsey@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;Tractor&quot;] }) # Print the data structure print(InfoDb) . [{&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;Annika&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Liao&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;April 26&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;San Diego&#39;, &#39;Email&#39;: &#39;liao.92127@gmail.com&#39;, &#39;Owns_Cars&#39;: [&#39;N/A&#39;]}, {&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;Lyndsey&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Couch&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;March 29&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;Hyden&#39;, &#39;Email&#39;: &#39;lyndsey@gmail.com&#39;, &#39;Owns_Cars&#39;: [&#39;Tractor&#39;]}] . Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet, to applications, or preparing it to be stored into a database -Exchange of data between programs includes the data type the method/function and the format of the data type | Application Programming Interface (API): write functions, receive, and return data. | . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . # print function: given a dictionary of InfoDb content def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop algorithm iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() . For loop output Annika Liao Residence: San Diego Birth Day: April 26 Cars: N/A Lyndsey Couch Residence: Hyden Birth Day: March 29 Cars: Tractor . Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . # while loop algorithm contains an initial n and an index incrementing statement (n += 1) def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() . While loop output Annika Liao Residence: San Diego Birth Day: April 26 Cars: N/A Lyndsey Couch Residence: Hyden Birth Day: March 29 Cars: Tractor . Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . # recursion algorithm loops incrementing on each call (n + 1) until exit condition is met def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) . Recursive loop output Annika Liao Residence: San Diego Birth Day: April 26 Cars: N/A Lyndsey Couch Residence: Hyden Birth Day: March 29 Cars: Tractor .",

            "content": "Honors Humanities . Principes and Elements of Design . Elements of design . Elements of design are structural parts of a work of art, which must be used according to principles of design in order to produce satisfactory work. Design is a structure of art with the elements and principles unifying the different parts and giving the work visual order. The elements and principles are always used in combination and therefore work together to create a work of art with good design. . SPACE: is absolutely necessary to all works of art because other elements are composed and developed within it. It can extend in either two (2-D) or three (3-D) dimensions. Space has no meaning until its limits are determined and its existence used. . FORMAT: once an artist has determined the size and shape of the area in which a work of art will be created, that area is referred to as the format. POSITIVE SPACE: the interior area of a shape, object, or form. NEGATIVE SPACE: the area exterior to, surrounding, or between shapes, objects, or forms. . LINE: is a basic structural element of art; all works of art have linear aspects. Paul Klee said, “A line is a dot going for a walk.” Lines may express response or excitement, strength or weakness, or other conditions. Lines have five characteristics: . LENGTH: short, long, continuous. WIDTH: thick, thin, carrying ATTITUDE: vertical, horizontal, diagonal CURVATURE: straight, shallow, tight TEXTURE: hard, soft, vibrant . SHAPE: the shape is produced by a continuous line connecting with itself; is usually regarded as a two-dimensional flat object. . FORM: usually regarded as three-dimensional objects or a shape that has the appearance of depth. . MASS: Bulk, weight, and density of three-dimensional forms, either actual or implied. . VOLUME: Any three-dimensional quantity that is bound or enclosed, whether solid or void. . COLOR: is a quality of visual sensation usually evoked by light stimulating the cones of the retina of the eye. Color has four qualities: . HUE: the generic name of a color, such as red, yellow, etc. INTENSITY: the brightness or dullness of a color. VALUE: the lightness or darkness of a color. Helps us understand two-dimensional art TEMPERATURE: the warm or cool quality in the appearance of a color, for example orange is a warm color, and green is a cool color. . TEXTURE: denotes the surface tactile qualities, usually described as being rough, smooth, coarse or fine, shiny or dull. The texture is understood through the sense of light. TRUE (actual) TEXTURE: occurs when the surface feels as it appears. Easily found in nature. FALSE (implied) TEXTURE: occurs when the actual surface appears to be a texture other than what it is; usually found in works of art. Principles of Design A principle is a rule to be followed in creating a design or composition. Design in the structure of art, with the elements and principles unifying the different parts and giving the work visual order. The elements and principles are always used in combination and therefore work together to create a work of art with good design. . BALANCE: equality of visual weight achieved through the use of one or more elements or design. SYMMETRICAL (formal) BALANCE: occurs when the elements on one side of the center are identical (but mirrored) to those of the other side. Asymmetrical (informal) BALANCE: occurs when the elements on one side of the center are not identical to those on the other, yet appear visually equal. RADIAL BALANCE: is similar to formal balance, but based on a circle with the center focal point. . UNITY: harmonious relationship of parts creating a single main idea, emotion, or point of view; obtained by relating elements of design to each other. REPETITION: unity is obtained by repeating specific elements of design to produce patterns and rhythms. PROGRESSION (movement): elements that cause the eye to move through a composition. . PATTERN: pattern uses the art elements in planned or random repetitions to enhance surfaces of paintings or sculptures. Patterns often occur in nature, and artists use similar repeated motifs to create patterns in their work. Pattern increases visual excitement by enriching the surface interest. . MOVEMENT: Artists to direct viewers through their work, often to focal areas, use visual movement. Such movement can be directed along lines, edges, shapes, and colors within works, but moves the eye most easily on the paths of equal value. . &lt;- Ex: bc lines are used to replicate movement when not moving . EMPHASIS: that part of a composition that is most important presents the main idea of the work of art. DOMINANCE: provides a center of interest, attracts attention, or makes one part of the composition appear most important. DOMINANT: the most prominent principle of the most obvious in the influence of position. THEME &amp; VARIATION: an idea or dominant feature that gives the artwork its character; the subject of a work of art, sometimes with a number of phases or different examples. SUBORDINATION (sub-dominance): those elements that are less dominating but provide interest and background into the composition. REST AREAS: those places within a composition that are relatively vacant, often regarded as negative shapes or spaces. . RHYTHM: visual movement achieved as the viewer’s eyes progress throughout a composition, moving and resting in regular or varied measures. REPETITION: of colors, shapes, textures, lines, etc. . HARMONY: the appearance of visual order obtained by relating elements of design to each other to create a sense of unity. APPROPRIATENESS: suitability of fitness of an idea, theme motif, or purpose to elements, media, or materials used in the creation of a work of art. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
