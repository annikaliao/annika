Learning Objectives: . Identify input(s) to a program | Identify output(s) producced by a program | . Identifying Inputs to Programs . Program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program | Computer programs accept input in various forms: tactile, audio, visual, text | . How do programs receive input? . “Events” are triggered by some action, which usually sends input to the program i.e. mouse clicks, screen-taps, button clicks, keyboard entries, audio triggers | . | Input can come from a user or other programs | . What does input accomplish in a program? . Input usually affects the output | Program outputs are any data sent from a program to a device | Outputs produced by devices: visual, audio, tectile, text | . How does a program know what to do upon an event? . In event-driven programming, program statements are executed when triggered, rather than through the sequential flow of control | An action triggers an event Action may be initiated by the user or another program/device | . | The program “jumps” to the code segment according to the event The code segment is executed | Output is triggered by the code segment (or additional events) | . | The program code is not necessarily executed in order Code segments are executed as they are called according to the events triggered | . | Program output is usually based on a program’s input or prior state i.e. internal values | . | . 1.2 Daily Video 3 . Learning Objectives: . Explain how a program or code segment functions | . What is a program? . A program is a collection of statements that performs a specific task when run by a computer A statement is a single command | A group of statements part of a program is called a code segment | Code segments are executed according to the rules of the programming language | A program is often referred to as software | . | The behavior of a program is how a program functions during execution and is often descirbed by how a user interacts with it | . Program Function . A program needs to work for a variety of inputs and situations Code segment would need to work for a variety of lists | Code segment could be inserted into a larger program | . | A program can be described broadly by what it does, or in more detail by both what the program does and how the program statements accomplish this function | Description should: state the function simply so someone could use the code segment in a larger program | include how it functions by explaining in detail how the code segment functions | . | . MCQ . . Our Team’s Final Project . Do we have final project ideas for a PBL Web Project? Yes, our team is planning to create a productive planner with many different uses. | . | Are we considering a project that is best for our educational purpose? Yes, most of us have minimal coding experience, so by creating a not too complicated but still useful application, we will all learn a lot. We can even utilize the application ourselves after it is complete. | . | Is the project going to hold team members interest for 8 weeks? Yes, there are many different elements to incorporate into this project. Even if we somehow complete our original plan, there is big capacity for new other elements to be implemented. | . | Does the project have potential for someone to use it beyond the 8 weeks? ie Customer or Sponsor needed? Yes, this application is very useful and can be utilized by anyone. A planner is something everyone needs, we are just making it even more convenient and useful. | . | Does the project have potential to be used for Create Performance Task submission?

I shared a few words of gratitude to my sister, Naomi. She is moving to Irvine for college tomorrow, and after the video, I thought there is no better time than now to share my gratitude. Naomi and I are not usually sentimental with each other, so I thought it’d be awkward, but she listened with a kind demeanor. I told her how grateful I am for her and what she does for me and others, and that I will miss her an impossible much when she goes back to college. She responded with kind words as well, she told me how grateful she is for me, and that she will miss me too. I do think this experience has increased my well-being, even if just a little. .

MCQ . . Underlying Thoughts From The MCQ . Is my group setup strictly on the basis of current friends and common interests? | No. Although I have known and talked to Haeryn and Sophia previously, we have never really been great friends. I met Liav for the first time through our APCSP class. All of us do share some common interests in one form or another, but that is not the reason our group is formed this way. We have many different interests but we all truly bonded through our interest in computer science. | . | Is my group setup with diversity in backgrounds, gender, and perspectives? | Yes. I am a Taiwanese female, Haeryn is a Korean female, Sophia is a Chinese female, and Liav is an Israeli male. So, there is a lot of diversity in our identities. As for perspectives, we all have different perspectives mostly due to our differing identities, however our perspectives do not clash, so we get along and collaborate well. | . | Is my group best equipped for the skill sets needed for success in classroom? | Yes. We all work hard and work well together, so there will be no lack of communication or anything along those lines. I believe our group will succeed and go above and beyond this trimester. | . | .",

            "content": "Idea 1: Song Snippet Game . Performance Task Outline . My first idea was to create a quiz-type game, where the questions each play a snippet of a song (5-10 seconds), and the user is to guess as many songs as possible before the timer runs out. I want to be able to link Spotify to the site, so that the song selections are personalized for each user, but if that is not possible, the song selection will be a pre-curated playlist of current top songs. The more songs you guess correct, the higher your score, which you will be able to compare with others through a leaderboard. Also, the faster you guess a song, the more points you will be rewarded. . College Board Requirements . Program Purpose and Function . The purpose of this program is entertainment, to test the user&#39;s knowledge on their own favorite songs, as well as current trending songs. After playing the song snippet, the user will input their guess on the song, and the output will be the user&#39;s score at the end of the quiz. . Data Abstraction . The data will be the user&#39;s guesses, collected at each question and in lists. Once the timer runs out, the data will be added together to provide the output, which is the score. The data will also be stored in a database to compare to other scores in the leaderboard. Also, there will be data collected from the user&#39;s personal Spotify account in order to create the personalized song snippets. . Managing Complexity . The amount of points rewarded will be different depending on how quick the user answers the question, and there is not specifically a set number of questions, the user will be given questions as long as the timer is ticking. The song snippets in each question will be provided from the user&#39;s own Spotify account, making the quiz much more complex. . Procedural Abstraction . The procedure is collecting data from the user&#39;s personal Spotify account, called song abstraction. This procedure creates an overall personalized quiz and experience for each user. . Algorithm Implementation . The main algorithm is collecting the answers that the user inputs into the quiz and giving the score, but collecting the song snippets to form questions will also be an algorithm. The sequence will be collection of data from the user&#39;s Spotify, then the generation of questions, then the user will complete the quiz, with the output score at the end. The selection will the user&#39;s choice in answer, which will be translated to a specific amount of points. The iteration will be the songs, and the points provided per questions according to the timer. . Testing . For the testing, I will record a video of me completing the quiz myself, and upon receiving the score, I will compare it to the other scores in the leaderboard. . Learning Preparation . Before beginning on this project, I will need to learn more about databases, algorithms, and iteration in data collection. I will also have to explore a lot to figure out how to incorporate the Spotify Web API into my project&#39;s software. . Additional Ideas . These ideas are some other concpets I may want to explore if Idea 1 is not right for me. . Personalized Playlist:- The user can either input their favorite artists and songs, or the system will automatically collect their data. Then, a personalized playlist of songs based off their collective music taste will be created. The user can also select the &quot;vibe&quot; of the playlist, such as upbeat or moody, and the playlist will be curated toward that. | Daily Diet: The user may check off their allergies or dietary restrictions, and this site will provide them with a list of recipes or dish inspiration to meet those restrictions. | . | .",

            "title": "Spider-Man Quiz (App Lab)",
            "content": ". Brainstorming Process . For my quiz, I wanted to choose a topic that I liked and was familiar with. At first, I wanted to do a quiz about music, but I thought that the questions may be too exclusive, as music is more self-expressive concept, so the quiz may not be enjoyable for everyone. I started thinking about what topics may have set material that could make for interesting questions. This led me to think more about trivia-based questions. As a character with an ingrained backstory and history, Spider-Man would make great trivia questions. Yes, Spider-Man-themed questions may be just as exclusive as music-themed questions, but the answers are set in stone, and not up to interpretation. . So, I went with a Spider-Man themed quiz. . Planning Process . First, I planned out how my quiz was going to run. How many questions it would have, how many answers for each question, how it would signify a correct or wrong answer. I also really wanted to include a point system. I decided to keep it simple with 3 questions and 4 answers just like the example quiz. I wanted to either have a pop-up or a different screen as a way to know if you got the questions right. . Then, I brainstormed potential questions I could include. I searched up Spider-Man trivia on Google as for inspiration as well. The questions needed to be simple and multiple choice based, with answers not too obvious, but not super tricky either. With Spider-Man having so many different adaptions, it was difficult to think of questions that wouldn’t contradict information of each the version. The very original comic version is very universal, so I based my questions off that. . Once I got all my questions, I envisioned the design of my quiz. How could I make it the most practical and user-friendly? I wanted a simple design with fun colors, but not distracting and flashy. I wanted images that contributed to the Spider-Man theme. For the correct and wrong screens, I took inspiration from the quiz site Kahoot, because it’s straightforward yet effective. To incorporate the point system, I wanted a scoreboard at the end of my quiz. . With all of these elements planned out, I was ready to start building my quiz. . Building Process . To start off and learn how to make the quiz work, I followed the code of the example. I created different screens for each question, as well as the start and end page. Then, I used buttons and OnEvent -&gt; function to make the quiz run as it’s supposed to. The questions are displayed and the top, the answer boxes are the buttons. By clicking the start button you’re led to the first question, by clicking the correct answer button you’re led to the “correct screen”, if you click the wrong answer button you’re led to the “wrong screen”, then the next question, and so on and so forth. . . To add a scoreboard at the end, I created a variable called “score” and set it to zero. To make the system add up points, for every time the user is navigated to the “correct page”, a point is added onto the score variable. If the user is navigated to the “wrong page”, then no points are added. On the end page, there is a display of text saying what you scored, using the data the score variable has collected. . . Result . My quiz includes a start screen, 3 questions screens, a screen to signify a correct answer as well as a separate screen to signify a wrong answer, and an end page. Specific buttons lead to the desired screens, for example, clicking the correct answer will send you to the correct page, which will have a button guiding you to the next question. For every correct answer, a point is tallied, and the total score is displayed on the end screen. . Play my quiz! .",

List and Dictionary purpose . List and Dictionaries are used to collect information | When information is collected it is formed into patterns Pattern is established you will be able collect many instances of that pattern. | . | List is used to collect many instances of a pattern | Dictionary is used to define data patterns | Iteration is often used to process through lists | . InfoDb = [] # InfoDB is a data structure with expected Keys and Values # Append to List a Dictionary of key/values related to a person and cars InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Annika&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Liao&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;April 26&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;liao.92127@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;N/A&quot;] }) # Append to List a 2nd Dictionary of key/values InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Lyndsey&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Couch&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;March 29&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;Hyden&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;lyndsey@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;Tractor&quot;] }) # Print the data structure print(InfoDb) . [{&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;Annika&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Liao&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;April 26&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;San Diego&#39;, &#39;Email&#39;: &#39;liao.92127@gmail.com&#39;, &#39;Owns_Cars&#39;: [&#39;N/A&#39;]}, {&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;Lyndsey&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Couch&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;March 29&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;Hyden&#39;, &#39;Email&#39;: &#39;lyndsey@gmail.com&#39;, &#39;Owns_Cars&#39;: [&#39;Tractor&#39;]}] . Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet, to applications, or preparing it to be stored into a database -Exchange of data between programs includes the data type the method/function and the format of the data type | Application Programming Interface (API): write functions, receive, and return data. | . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . # print function: given a dictionary of InfoDb content def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop algorithm iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() . For loop output Annika Liao Residence: San Diego Birth Day: April 26 Cars: N/A Lyndsey Couch Residence: Hyden Birth Day: March 29 Cars: Tractor . Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . # while loop algorithm contains an initial n and an index incrementing statement (n += 1) def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() . While loop output Annika Liao Residence: San Diego Birth Day: April 26 Cars: N/A Lyndsey Couch Residence: Hyden Birth Day: March 29 Cars: Tractor . Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . # recursion algorithm loops incrementing on each call (n + 1) until exit condition is met def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) . Recursive loop output Annika Liao Residence: San Diego Birth Day: April 26 Cars: N/A Lyndsey Couch Residence: Hyden Birth Day: March 29 Cars: Tractor .",

Elements of design are structural parts of a work of art, which must be used according to principles of design in order to produce satisfactory work. Design is a structure of art with the elements and principles unifying the different parts and giving the work visual order. The elements and principles are always used in combination and therefore work together to create a work of art with good design. . SPACE: is absolutely necessary to all works of art because other elements are composed and developed within it. It can extend in either two (2-D) or three (3-D) dimensions. Space has no meaning until its limits are determined and its existence used. . FORMAT: once an artist has determined the size and shape of the area in which a work of art will be created, that area is referred to as the format. POSITIVE SPACE: the interior area of a shape, object, or form. NEGATIVE SPACE: the area exterior to, surrounding, or between shapes, objects, or forms. . LINE: is a basic structural element of art; all works of art have linear aspects. Paul Klee said, “A line is a dot going for a walk.” Lines may express response or excitement, strength or weakness, or other conditions. Lines have five characteristics: . LENGTH: short, long, continuous. WIDTH: thick, thin, carrying ATTITUDE: vertical, horizontal, diagonal CURVATURE: straight, shallow, tight TEXTURE: hard, soft, vibrant . SHAPE: the shape is produced by a continuous line connecting with itself; is usually regarded as a two-dimensional flat object. . FORM: usually regarded as three-dimensional objects or a shape that has the appearance of depth. . MASS: Bulk, weight, and density of three-dimensional forms, either actual or implied. . VOLUME: Any three-dimensional quantity that is bound or enclosed, whether solid or void. . COLOR: is a quality of visual sensation usually evoked by light stimulating the cones of the retina of the eye. Color has four qualities: . HUE: the generic name of a color, such as red, yellow, etc. INTENSITY: the brightness or dullness of a color. VALUE: the lightness or darkness of a color. Helps us understand two-dimensional art TEMPERATURE: the warm or cool quality in the appearance of a color, for example orange is a warm color, and green is a cool color. . TEXTURE: denotes the surface tactile qualities, usually described as being rough, smooth, coarse or fine, shiny or dull. The texture is understood through the sense of light. TRUE (actual) TEXTURE: occurs when the surface feels as it appears. Easily found in nature. FALSE (implied) TEXTURE: occurs when the actual surface appears to be a texture other than what it is; usually found in works of art. Principles of Design A principle is a rule to be followed in creating a design or composition. Design in the structure of art, with the elements and principles unifying the different parts and giving the work visual order. The elements and principles are always used in combination and therefore work together to create a work of art with good design. . BALANCE: equality of visual weight achieved through the use of one or more elements or design. SYMMETRICAL (formal) BALANCE: occurs when the elements on one side of the center are identical (but mirrored) to those of the other side. Asymmetrical (informal) BALANCE: occurs when the elements on one side of the center are not identical to those on the other, yet appear visually equal. RADIAL BALANCE: is similar to formal balance, but based on a circle with the center focal point. . UNITY: harmonious relationship of parts creating a single main idea, emotion, or point of view; obtained by relating elements of design to each other. REPETITION: unity is obtained by repeating specific elements of design to produce patterns and rhythms. PROGRESSION (movement): elements that cause the eye to move through a composition. . PATTERN: pattern uses the art elements in planned or random repetitions to enhance surfaces of paintings or sculptures. Patterns often occur in nature, and artists use similar repeated motifs to create patterns in their work. Pattern increases visual excitement by enriching the surface interest. . MOVEMENT: Artists to direct viewers through their work, often to focal areas, use visual movement. Such movement can be directed along lines, edges, shapes, and colors within works, but moves the eye most easily on the paths of equal value. . &lt;- Ex: bc lines are used to replicate movement when not moving . EMPHASIS: that part of a composition that is most important presents the main idea of the work of art. DOMINANCE: provides a center of interest, attracts attention, or makes one part of the composition appear most important. DOMINANT: the most prominent principle of the most obvious in the influence of position. THEME &amp; VARIATION: an idea or dominant feature that gives the artwork its character; the subject of a work of art, sometimes with a number of phases or different examples. SUBORDINATION (sub-dominance): those elements that are less dominating but provide interest and background into the composition. REST AREAS: those places within a composition that are relatively vacant, often regarded as negative shapes or spaces. . RHYTHM: visual movement achieved as the viewer’s eyes progress throughout a composition, moving and resting in regular or varied measures. REPETITION: of colors, shapes, textures, lines, etc. . HARMONY: the appearance of visual order obtained by relating elements of design to each other to create a sense of unity. APPROPRIATENESS: suitability of fitness of an idea, theme motif, or purpose to elements, media, or materials used in the creation of a work of art. .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) . The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it. . . Interactive Charts With Altair . Charts made with Altair remain interactive.

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
