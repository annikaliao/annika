College Board Essential Knowledge . A software library contains procedures that can be used in the creation of new programs. | Existing segments of code can come from internal or external sources, ie. libraries or previously written code. | The use of libraries simplifies the task of creating complex programs. | Application program interfaces (APIs) are specifications for how the procedures in a library behave and can be used. | Documentation for a library or API is necessary in understanding the key behaviors provided by the API/library and how to utilize them in your work. | . Defining a Library . A library is a collection of code from an external source that can be used to add functionality to a program. | Libraries are very useful, as they can be used to save time and effort in the development process. | Libraries are usually included in a program using a special keyword called &quot; .&quot; This keyword tells the program to look for the library and use its code. | . Example . import math math.sqrt(64) . 8.0 . Review Questions (Answer for candy!) . . 1) In your own words, what is a library? . 2) Why are libraries useful when writing a program? . 3) What keyword is used to add a pre-made library? . Hacks . Write a program that uses a library/libraries in any sort of manner. | Explain your work/code | . . . Lesson 3.15.1 . What is randomization? . 1) Randomization generates a value between two numbers. For example RANDOM(1,3) may result as 1 or 2 or 3, either one of those. . 2) Now if we look into our day to day life we can see that randomization is all around us. . Now for a piece of candy does anyone want to tell us an example of randomization during our day to day life. . 3) In order to use the random function we have to first import random at the very beggining. . Now lets look at the code below right here. . import random answer1 = random.randint(0,3) answer2 = random.randint(1,8) answer3 = answer1 + answer2 print(answer3) . 8 . 1) The lowest number that will be generated is 0 for answer 1 and for answer2, the lowest that will be generated is 1 so the lowest number that can be generated for answer 3 would be 1. . 2) The highest number that will be generated to answer1 is 3 and the highest number that will be generated for answer 2 is 8 so the highest number for answer 3 would be 11. . 3) The range of numbers that answer 3 could print out would be from 1 to 11. . So a normal dice contains six sides with 1-6 on the individual sides. Which of the following code would simulate the result of rolling the dice three times and adds together all the obtained values together? . A. . import random sum = random.randint(1,6) + random.randint(1,6) + random.randint(1,6) print(sum) . 12 . B. . import random sum = random.randint(1,18) print(sum) . 17 . C. . import random sum = 3*random.randint(1,6) print(sum) . 12 . 1) Its not B because B is saying that it is going to choose one number between the range of 1 and 18 and not the sum of 3 diff numbers. . 2) C is not correct also because C is saying that the computer is choosing one random between 1 and 6 and multiplying that 3 times but we want the sum of three different numbers between 1 and 6. . 3) So the answer is A. . . For the last example: . import random i = 1 while i &lt; 4: choose = random.randint(1,10) print(choose) i += 1 . 6 9 8 . Which answers could not be possible for the code above? . A. 4 7 6 . B. 9 1 8 . C. 2 11 5 . D. 5 10 2 . Random can also have different methods, in the above examples we only used one example, randint which returns a random number between the given range. Down below I have created a table of all the methods with the description of what it is used for with the random function. . Method | Description . seed() | Initialize the random number generator . getstate() | Returns the current internal state of the random number generator . setstate() | Restores the internal state of the random number generator . getrandbits() | Returns a number representing the random bits . randrange() | Returns a random number between the given range . randint() | Returns a random number between the given range . choice() | Returns a random element from the given sequence . choices() | Returns a list with a random selection from the given sequence . shuffle() | Takes a sequence and returns the sequence in a random order . sample() | Returns a given sample of a sequence . random() | Returns a random float number between 0 and 1 . uniform() | Returns a random float number between two given parameters . betavariate() | Returns a random float number between 0 and 1 based on the Beta distribution (used in statistics) . expovariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Exponential distribution (used in statistics) . gammavariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Gamma distribution (used in statistics) . gauss() | Returns a random float number based on the Gaussian distribution (used in probability theories) . lognormvariate() | Returns a random float number based on a log-normal distribution (used in probability theories) . normalvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the normal distribution (used in probability theories) . vonmisesvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the von Mises distribution (used in directional statistics) . paretovariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Pareto distribution (used in probability theories) . weibullvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Weibull distribution (used in statistics) . Lesson Recap: 1) random function generates a random number from a to b (range of two numbers) . 2) You need to import random in order to use the random function . 3) Every result from an import function is equally likely to occur . Hacks for lesson 3.15.1 . Write a few lines of code that implements the import function . | Define what an import random function do . | List a few other things that we can import other than random . | . . . 3.15.2 Lesson . Some Essential Knowledge that you need to know | RANDOM (a,b) will provide you with a random integer between the numbers a-b | Ex. RANDOM (7,18) can provide you with the number 13. | Using a random generator means each result can come out as different. | . Lets Try an Example Scenario . Try and formulate a way to write a segment of code that can simulate the flipping of a coin. | You have to use a random generator and assign the output of &quot;Heads&quot; or &quot;Tails&quot; to a specified result. | . import random flip = random.randint(1,2) if flip == 1: print(&quot;Heads&quot;) else: print(&quot;Tails&quot;) # Try this code for yourself! . Heads . This is a pretty simple code to understand. | First we use the randomization here between the 1 and 2 to determine which side of the coin we get. | If we get 1 then we get heads. If we get 2 or anything else than 2, then we get Tails. | . Now let&#39;s answer questions using your knowledge. . If you want yes to show up 50% of the time, which of the code segments can you use? | . random(1,100) &lt;= 50 random(1,100) == 50 random(1,10) &lt;= 5 random(1,10) &gt;= 5 . The answer is A,C, and D! | . Why isn&#39;t the answer B? . This because when you are saying equal to 50, you are saying only when this one number shows up the output will be yes. | You want it to come up 50 percent of the time not just when that one number shows up. | .

Basics of Procedures | Calling Procedures | Determine Results of Procedures | . What is a procedure? . Essential Knowledge: . A procedure is a named set of instructions that can take in parameters and return values. May be called &quot;method&quot; or &quot;function&quot; in different programming languages. | . | Parameters are independent variables used in the procedure to produce a result. It allows a procedure to execute without initially knowing specific input values. | Procedures can be classified as sequencing, selection, and iteration. How? | . Example: . What is the procedure&#39;s name? | What are the parameters? | What did the procedure return? | . x = 5 y = 3 def multiply(x, y): product = x * y return product answer = multiply(x, y) print(&quot;The product of&quot;, x, &quot;times&quot;, y, &quot;is&quot;, answer) . The product of 5 times 3 is 15 . Calling Procedures . To call a procedure you would write the name of the procedure followed by the parentheses with the parameters of the procedure | Procedures do not require parameters, but the parentheses must be there | . Ex: . procedureName(parameter1, parameter2, ...) | How would you call this procedure? | . num = 5 def math(x): op1 = x * 2 op2 = op1 - 9 return op2 . Quiz (Part of Hacks) .

Determining the Result of a Procedure . To determine the result of a procedure or any code, you must follow the code line by line and see what each one does . | Using syntax, you can determine the result by . function parameters | return value and statements | . | . To use return values, you have to write the syntax return followed by the expression you would like to return var | . A return statement exits a function and instructs python to continue executing the program and to return a certain value . | Value can be string, a tuple, or any other type that is being sent back to the main program . | . Ex: . def divide(num1,num2): x = num1/num2 return x . what is x being assigned to inside the function? . | As a reminder, to use function parameters, you would have to write the syntax name of the function followed by the parameters needed in parentheses . | Function parameters are the parameters that are used when calling the function in order to get a result. . | . What are the function parameters in this procedure? . What values are being passed to the function? . def function(first_name, last_name): print(first_name + &quot; &quot; + last_name) function(&quot;Peter&quot;,&quot;Parker&quot;) function(&quot;Safin&quot;, &quot;Singh&quot;) . Peter Parker Safin Singh . In the cell above, the function is being called twice, which shows the importance of function in order to accomplish the same thing with different parameters. . What is wrong with the function? . Can you translate the binary numbers into decimal notation? . def find_cube(num): result = bin(num * num * num) cube = find_cube(3) cube2 = find_cube(4) print(&#39;Cube:&#39;,cube) print(&#39;Cube:&#39;,cube2 ) . Cube: None Cube: None . Once again, I called the function twice, which is useful, because it allows the coder to do the same thing multiple times with different arguments. . Topic 3.13 (3.B) Managing Complexity - Safin . Overview: Learning Objectives . increasing code modularity using procedures abstracting large problems into smaller ones | extract shared features to reduce code duplication | . | using parameters to reuse procedures | improving code readability with procedures | manipulating procedure logic and preserving outputEssentially, we&#39;ll learn how and when it is appropriate to construct a function (procedural abstraction) and what its benefits are . | . Vocabulary: . Modularity - the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program | Abstraction - the practice of hiding the details of how a particular code or system works and exposing only the essential features or functions that are necessary for other parts of the program to use | Duplication - having multiple duplicate code blocks, often decreasing readability and efficiency | Logic - the sequence of steps and operations that a computer follows to execute a program, including the specific instructions and decision-making processes built into the code | . Parameters . As we saw above, parameters can be used to make functions work with multiple different inputs. Let&#39;s review the following code . # these parameters are the inputs to the function, and they are used # inside the function to perform some operation def add(x, y): # inside the function, we can use the x and y parameters just like # we would use any other variable result = x + y return result # to call the function and pass in values for the x and y parameters, # we simply provide the values as arguments in the function call result = add(2, 3) print(result) # should output 5 # we can also use variables as arguments in the function call x = 5 y = 10 result = add(x, y) print(result) # should output 15 # we can even use the result of one function call as an argument # in another function call result = add(add(2, 3), add(4, 5)) print(result) # should output 14 . 5 15 14 . In the above example, parameters were used to create a function that could be called multiple times without code duplication. . Modularity . In the following example, we will use specialized functions and explain their benefits: . import math def hypotenuse(leg1, leg2): # notice we&#39;re using this &lt;var&gt; * &lt;var&gt; syntax multiple times? # this has multiple drawbacks: # - it&#39;s repetitive and makes the code longer # - if we wanted to change the operator being # applied to `leg1` and `leg2`, we&#39;d have to do it twice! leg1_squared = leg1 * leg1 leg2_squared = leg2 * leg2 return math.sqrt(leg1_squared + leg2_squared) ## VERSUS ## # this works, but let&#39;s try to write the &quot;squared&quot; variable assignment statements more concisely... def square(a): return a * a def hypotenuse_abstracted(leg1, leg2): # not only is this shorter, but we can now: # - better understand the code at a glance--we know exactly # what `square` should do # - change the operator in a single place (`square`) rather than # multiple times within this hypotenuse function leg1_squared = square(leg1) leg2_squared = square(leg2) return math.sqrt(leg1_squared + leg2_squared) ## EXTRA CHALLENGE ## # is it possible to write the `hypotenuse` function in a single line? def hypotenuse_abstracted2(leg1, leg2): # ... pass assert hypotenuse(3, 4) == hypotenuse_abstracted(3, 4) == 5 . Abstracting Shared Features . Say we want to create a set of functions that count the number of words in a sentence that start with a certain character. We want to create... . count_words_starting_with_a_in_string(sentence) | count_words_starting_with_d_in_string(sentence) | . In order to count words starting with a certain character, we&#39;ll first need to split up the sentence into words. This behavior will be shared across both functions we intend to create, so procedural abstraction is appropriate here. . # is a separate element in the list def split_string(s): # use the split() method to split the string into a list of words words = s.split(&quot; &quot;) # initialize a new list to hold all non-empty strings new_words = [] for word in words: if word != &quot;&quot;: # add all non-empty substrings of `words` to `new_words` new_words.append(word) return words # this function takes a list of words as input and returns the number of words # that start with the given letter (case-insensitive) def count_words_starting_with_letter(words, letter): count = 0 # loop through the list of words and check if each word starts with the given letter for word in words: # use the lower() method to make the comparison case-insensitive if word.lower().startswith(letter): count += 1 return count # this function takes a string as input and returns the number of words that start with &#39;a&#39; def count_words_starting_with_a_in_string(s): # use the split_string() function to split the input string into a list of words words = split_string(s) # use the count_words_starting_with_letter() function to count the number of words # that start with &#39;a&#39; in the list of words count = count_words_starting_with_letter(words, &quot;a&quot;) return count # see above def count_words_starting_with_d_in_string(s): words = split_string(s) count = count_words_starting_with_letter(words, &quot;d&quot;) return count # example usage: s = &quot; This is a test string! Don&#39;t you think this is cool? &quot; a_count = count_words_starting_with_a_in_string(s) d_count = count_words_starting_with_d_in_string(s) print(&quot;Words starting with a:&quot;, a_count) print(&quot;Words starting with d:&quot;, d_count) . Words starting with a: 1 Words starting with d: 1 . In the above example, we have: . defined several functions that perform different tasks related to processing a string | abstracted away shared behavior for both functions that count the number of words starting with a specific character in a string | . Topic 3.13 (3.C) Developing Procedures - David &amp; Alex . Overview: Learning Objectives . parameters being used to manage complexity parameters storing variables | parameters storing arguments | . | calling functions with procedure names choosing procedure names | calling procedures in python and javascript | . | . Vocabulary: . Procedure - a module of code that is created to complete a certain task, this is basically a function | Procedure Name - the name that is given to a function/procedure | Parameters - a variable that is used in a function to allow for data to be imported into a function | Arguments - a way to provide information to a function, usually defined outside a function and then imported into a function with parameters | . Functions - Basic Structure . Functions can be created in many different languages. Below are some examples in Collegeboard&#39;s format, Python, and Javascript. . Collegeboard . Above, the function is defined as PROCEDURE, which tells the coder that this is a function. The function is then named with procName, which is simply how the function is identified. parameter1, parameter2,... are variables that can be predefined elsewhere and repeatedly used in the same function. This will be gone over later in the lesson so don&#39;t worry if you don&#39;t get it. block of statements are just things that you would place inside a function to complete a certain task, such as print() in Python. . Python . def function(a,b): # function is defined print(a+b) # prints output of variables function(1,2) # one instance that it can be used function(2,3) # another instance . 3 5 . Python is similar to the Collegeboard example, where def defines the function, function, and then is followed by parameters a,b, which can later be interchanged with any numbers as shown with function(1,2). The numbers are called arguments, which are information provided to the function with parameters. In this case, the parameters are being added within the function and then printed. . Javascript . function Function(a,b) { return a + b; } Function(1,2) Function(2,3) . 3 5 . Javascript in this case is almost the exact same as Python, the only differences being that function is called with function and that the formatting is a little different. Otherwise, it does the exact same thing as the Python example. . Example . function div(a,b) { return (a+b)/2 } div(3,7) . What is the procedure name? | What are the parameters? | What operation is being done? | what would the output of this code be? | . Parameters . In functions, there are sometimes parameters that the functions have in which you can call to the function giving arguements that will provide input to the function For example: | . def function(num1, num2): if num1 &gt; num2: print(&quot;num1 is greater than num2&quot;) elif num1 &lt;num2: print(&quot;num1 is less than num 2&quot;) num1= 6 num2 = 8 function(num1,num2) . num1 is less than num 2 . In this function, it takes in two parameters num1 and num2 | Whithin this function it uses conditionals to determine if num 1 is larger or smaller than num2 | When calling to this function we must put in two arguements, num1 and num2 respectively | We put in 6 for num1 and 8 for num2 and the algorithm runs and gives us an outcome | . This basic function in python can be recreated in Javasript . function compare(a,b) { if(a&gt;b) { console.log(&quot;a is greater than b&quot;) } else if (a&lt;b) { console.log(&quot;a is less than b&quot;) } } // How do you call to this function? . what are the parameters? | What is the output? | what are the arguements? | . Calling functions . When calling functions, you have to ask yourself some questions Does the function have any parameters? | does the parameter have output? | . | Depending on these answers, the way you will call to a function will be different | . Example where it does does have parameters and gives output . def InchestoFeet(inches): Feet = 0 Feet = inches / 12 return Feet result = InchestoFeet(24) print(result) . 2 . If you look closely, there is a return at the end of the function, this returns a value when you call the function | This is why we have to set a variable, in this case result equal to the output of the function. | Also one thing to notice is that this function also takes in a parameter called inches | . Here&#39;s an example of calling functions in HTML with Javascript: . HI . . &lt;!-- function is called here --&gt; &lt;button id=&quot;enter&quot; onclick=&quot;print(a,b)&quot;&gt;HI&lt;/button&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;result&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- javascript --&gt; &lt;script&gt; function print(a,b) { document.getElementById(&quot;result&quot;).innerHTML = a + b // math } // variables are defined var a = 1 var b = 2 &lt;/script&gt; .

Today we will be looking at algorithms from another standpoint. Q: How many ways are there to peel a banana? Is the result the same? . Main Idea 1: Algorithms can be written in different ways and still do the same thing . However, Algorithms that look similar might not always have the same result | Different algorithms can be used to solve the same problem | . Examples! . The goal with the two algorithms below is to show &quot;Wow! Good job!&quot; when you get an A and show &quot;Nice!&quot; when you get a B or C (pass), if you don&#39;t pass (lower than 70) it will show &quot;Do Better&quot; . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) if grade &gt;= 90: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) if 70 &lt;= grade &lt; 90: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif grade &lt; 70: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . Yay! it worked! Lets look at the next one. Do you notice any differences? Do you think this algorithm will still achieve the same goal? If not, what is the flaw? . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) if grade &gt;= 90: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) elif 70 &lt; grade &lt; 90: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif grade &lt; 70: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . So, why is this important? Why are we even doing this? . When 2 algorithms look extremely similar, it is easy to assume they do the same thing. However, that is not the case and we have learn how to notice small differences in code and pretty much debug. . just know that codes that look similar don&#39;t always produce the same things :) | . Real-life situation (Storytime) . Tommy and Billy are working on solving the same issue with an algorithm Tommy creates a functioning code and yells &quot;I did it!&quot; He looks over at his friend Billy which is having a bit of trouble and he offers help However, Billy&#39;s code looks basically the same! which confuses them Then they remeber that they were taught that algorithms that look similar don&#39;t always have the same results and they collaborate to do further investigation:) . Now, without running, investigate the algorithm below. This one looks different. Do you thing it will still achieve the same goal as above? . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) A = grade &gt;= 90 B = 70 &lt;= grade &lt; 90 C = grade &lt; 70 if A: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) elif B: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif C: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . Why is this important? When collaborating or working on group projects, two people might come up with two different ways to solve a problem, and that happens a lot. . know that same goal can be achieved in many ways (the possibilities are endless) | make notes in you code! (explain how it works to others or you future self) | . How to write Nested Conditionals as Boolean expressions . the following 2 pieces of code is supposed to print &quot;don&#39;t go to school&quot; unless: . it is a weekday | it is a holiday | . isHoliday = False isWeekday = True #if holiday, dont go to school if isHoliday == True: print(&quot;don&#39;t go to school!&quot;) # otherwise, if it is a weekday, go to school else: if isWeekday == True: print(&quot;go to school!&quot;) # but if it is neither a weekday or holiday, don&#39;t go to school else: print(&quot;don&#39;t go to school&quot;) . isHoliday = False isWeekday = True # setting variables here (same as above to make comparison easier) driveSchool = not(isHoliday) and isWeekday if driveSchool == False: print(&quot;don&#39;t go to school!&quot;) if driveSchool == True: print(&quot;go to school!&quot;) # now we can make a regular conditional/ if statement without having a nested conditional . Hacks . Make your own version of this! Requirements: . main goal of algorithm | main/base algorithm (includes a nested conditional) Either: | an algorithm that visual looks like the first one but is flawed, has a different result, or both explain the flaw either in notes of your code or in a markdown Or: | . | an algorithm that looks very different from first algorithm but has some result/ solves the same problem explanation/ comparison of this algorithm with the first one | . | change your nested conditional from your main/base algorithm to a boolean expression The Algorithms don&#39;t have to be super complicated! But it should be complex enough to show a good understanding of this lesson as well as previous ones Scoring Rubric: | 0.05 for an interesting goal | 0.05 for a well completed main algorithm | 0.05 either an algorithm that looks the same but is different or looks different an is the same | 0.05 for explanation of that algorithm and why your understanding of this is important to you as a coder | 0.05 for the vested conditional to boolean conversion | total: 0.25 ### 3.9.2 Developing Algorithms (Annika) | . Developing Algorithms . When creating an algorithm, its good to outline its process before coding This ensures that it is sequenced correctly | . | You should represent the algorithm using a flowchart or natural language Visualization can help you better see the flow of the whole algorithm | This may allow for the coding process to be more efficient and effective | . | . Review of Selection and Iteration . Algorithms with iteration repeat a function until a goal is reached To more easily represent an algorithm without showing all the repeated steps, we can use iteration | . | Algorithms with selection only go through certain functions if certain things are true or false | . Example 1 . Start | The number of pretzels in the pack is 6 | Eat one fruit snack, number of pretzels in pack goes down by 1 | How many pretzels are left? | Repeat step 3 until number of pretzels is 0 | Display that pack is empty | Finish | pretzel = 6 while (pretzel &gt; 0): pretzel -= 1 print(pretzel) if pretzel == 0: print(&quot;All done!&quot;) . Example 2 . The parking rate for a garage is as follows: Less than one hour: Free 1-2 hours: $5 &lt;br&gt; 2-3 hours: $8 3-4 hours: $10 &lt;br&gt; 4+ hours: $12 . . Start | Input number of hours parked | If hours is less than 1, cost is free | If hours is between 1 and 2, cost is $5 | If hours is between 2 and 3, cost is $8 | If hours is between 3 and 4, cost is $10 | If hours is more than 4, cost is $12 | Display cost and goodbye | Finish | print(&quot;The parking rate is as follows: n Less than one hour: Free n 1-2 hours: $5 n 2-3 hours: $8 n 3-4 hours: $10 n 4+ hours: $12&quot;) time = float(input(&quot;How many hours have you parked at this garage?&quot;)) print(&quot;How many hours have you parked at this garage?&quot;) print(time, &quot;hours costs:&quot;) if time &lt; 1 : print(&quot;Free&quot;) elif time &gt;= 1 and time &lt; 2 : print(&quot;$5&quot;) elif time &gt;= 2 and time &lt; 3 : print(&quot;$8&quot;) elif time &gt;= 3 and time &lt; 4 : print(&quot;$10&quot;) else: print(&quot;$12&quot;) print(&quot;Have a good day!&quot;) . Hacks . Develop your own complex algorithm using a flowchart and natural language, then code it! . Requirements: . Includes both a flowchart AND natural language | Working code of the same algorithm | Incorporates selection AND/OR iteration | Make it creative! | . Tips: . This site is good for making flowcharts! | Natural language should just be a list | Think about the whole process, not just the end result | .

Main Idea . Knowing existing algorithms can help construct new ones | simple existing algorithms can include determining min or max of two or more numbers | computing the sum or average | identifying if an integer is even or odd | . | Using existing correct algorithms can help as building blocks to reduce development time, testing, and identification of errors | . Create an algorithm that will start with any positive integer n and display the full sequence of numbers that result from following the Collatz Conjecture. . Example: 6 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 10 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 16 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1 . What does this function do? . if (n MOD 2 = 0) { display(&quot;n is even&quot;) } else { display(&quot;n is odd&quot;) } . By modifying the preexisting code, we can write create new code that follows th Collatz Conjecture. . DISPLAY (&quot;Choose a value for n&quot;) n &lt;- INPUT () REPEAT UNTIL (n = 1) { IF (n MOD 2 = 0 ) { n &lt;- n/2 } ELSE { n &lt;- n * 3 + 1 } . Hacks . Fix the number guessing game .

My answer: A) The code segment iterates through myList, comparing each element to all other elements in the list. Answer: B) The code segment iterates through myList, comparing each element to all subsequent elements in the list. . I could tell that there is iteration, but I didn’t consider that it would need to be in subsequent order. To be truly honest, I didn’t know what subsequent meant, so I didn’t consider this factor. The algorithm traverses myList using two nested loops. The outer loop iterates from the first element in the list to the second-to-last element in the list. For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop compares that element to every subsequent element in the array. . Q13 . Test cases for allPositive in a list . . My answer: B) [-2, -1, 0] Answer: C) [-1, 0, 1] . I got confused with the 0 in the answer; 0 is not a positive number. The procedure traverses this list and eventually encounters the positive value 1. At this point, the procedure returns true when it should return false because the list does not contain only positive values. .",

Ways to find and correct errors: test cases | hand tracing | visualizations | debuggers | adding extra output statement | . | The easiest error to correct is usually the syntax error Most integrated development environments (IDEs) display information when there is a syntax error | This information usually directs the programmer to the line in the program where the error has occurred | Sometimes the user needs to do a little digging to find the error | . | More difficult to find and correct are logic errors A logic error is not always immediately noticed | Using multiple test cases is the first strategy programmers use to find logic errors | . | Hand-tracing is most useful with iteration (loops) Hand tracing is simply writing out the values of the variables within the loop as it iterates to determine if the outcome is correct | Hand tracing can be useful for small code segments and loops that iterate a small number of times | Larger code segments or loops might require a debugging program | . | Another strategy is adding extra output statements A programmer would use this strategy to help find and fix an error | Once the error is corrected, the extra output statements are usually removed | This has a similar effect as hand tracing, but allows the computer to do more of the work | . | If those strategies fail Some IDEs allow programmers to use visualizations and/or debuggers Visualiztions show graphs, images, color etc. that help determine if a program is working correctly | Debuggers use software designed to run a program, allowing it to be paused and tested iin the midst of running to determine if it is working properly | . | . | .

How do programs receive input? . “Events” are triggered by some action, which usually sends input to the program i.e. mouse clicks, screen-taps, button clicks, keyboard entries, audio triggers | . | Input can come from a user or other programs | . What does input accomplish in a program? . Input usually affects the output | Program outputs are any data sent from a program to a device | Outputs produced by devices: visual, audio, tectile, text | . How does a program know what to do upon an event? . In event-driven programming, program statements are executed when triggered, rather than through the sequential flow of control | An action triggers an event Action may be initiated by the user or another program/device | . | The program “jumps” to the code segment according to the event The code segment is executed | Output is triggered by the code segment (or additional events) | . | The program code is not necessarily executed in order Code segments are executed as they are called according to the events triggered | . | Program output is usually based on a program’s input or prior state i.e. internal values | . | . 1.2 Daily Video 3 . Learning Objectives: . Explain how a program or code segment functions | . What is a program? . A program is a collection of statements that performs a specific task when run by a computer A statement is a single command | A group of statements part of a program is called a code segment | Code segments are executed according to the rules of the programming language | A program is often referred to as software | . | The behavior of a program is how a program functions during execution and is often descirbed by how a user interacts with it | . Program Function . A program needs to work for a variety of inputs and situations Code segment would need to work for a variety of lists | Code segment could be inserted into a larger program | . | A program can be described broadly by what it does, or in more detail by both what the program does and how the program statements accomplish this function | Description should: state the function simply so someone could use the code segment in a larger program | include how it functions by explaining in detail how the code segment functions | . | . MCQ . . Our Team’s Final Project . Do we have final project ideas for a PBL Web Project? Yes, our team is planning to create a productive planner with many different uses. | . | Are we considering a project that is best for our educational purpose? Yes, most of us have minimal coding experience, so by creating a not too complicated but still useful application, we will all learn a lot. We can even utilize the application ourselves after it is complete. | . | Is the project going to hold team members interest for 8 weeks? Yes, there are many different elements to incorporate into this project. Even if we somehow complete our original plan, there is big capacity for new other elements to be implemented. | . | Does the project have potential for someone to use it beyond the 8 weeks? ie Customer or Sponsor needed? Yes, this application is very useful and can be utilized by anyone. A planner is something everyone needs, we are just making it even more convenient and useful. | . | Does the project have potential to be used for Create Performance Task submission? Yes, in our project there are many ways to implement code that includes sequencing, selection and iteration, procedures and lists, etc. in a functionable and creative way | . | .",

I shared a few words of gratitude to my sister, Naomi. She is moving to Irvine for college tomorrow, and after the video, I thought there is no better time than now to share my gratitude. Naomi and I are not usually sentimental with each other, so I thought it’d be awkward, but she listened with a kind demeanor. I told her how grateful I am for her and what she does for me and others, and that I will miss her an impossible much when she goes back to college. She responded with kind words as well, she told me how grateful she is for me, and that she will miss me too. I do think this experience has increased my well-being, even if just a little. . Gratitude List . My family | My friends | Nourishing food everyday | Comfortable living | Healthy body | Music | Art | My comfortable bed | All of my clothes | Mascara | Cookies | Roller coasters | Good grades | Animals and pets | The internet | . Goals . Sleep at least 6 hours a night Recently, I haven’t had the best sleeping habits, but I haven’t made that much of an effort to fix it. I know these habits are wrong, and I know that I will have to commit and take charge of the issue for something to happen. | . | Change up my workload schedule I also do not have the best habits in doing homework and studying, so I will need to put that into work.

Is my group setup strictly on the basis of current friends and common interests? | No. Although I have known and talked to Haeryn and Sophia previously, we have never really been great friends. I met Liav for the first time through our APCSP class. All of us do share some common interests in one form or another, but that is not the reason our group is formed this way. We have many different interests but we all truly bonded through our interest in computer science. | . | Is my group setup with diversity in backgrounds, gender, and perspectives? | Yes. I am a Taiwanese female, Haeryn is a Korean female, Sophia is a Chinese female, and Liav is an Israeli male. So, there is a lot of diversity in our identities. As for perspectives, we all have different perspectives mostly due to our differing identities, however our perspectives do not clash, so we get along and collaborate well. | . | Is my group best equipped for the skill sets needed for success in classroom? | Yes.

            "content": "Idea 1: Song Snippet Game . Performance Task Outline . My first idea was to create a quiz-type game, where the questions each play a snippet of a song (5-10 seconds), and the user is to guess as many songs as possible before the timer runs out. I want to be able to link Spotify to the site, so that the song selections are personalized for each user, but if that is not possible, the song selection will be a pre-curated playlist of current top songs. The more songs you guess correct, the higher your score, which you will be able to compare with others through a leaderboard. Also, the faster you guess a song, the more points you will be rewarded. . College Board Requirements . Program Purpose and Function . The purpose of this program is entertainment, to test the user&#39;s knowledge on their own favorite songs, as well as current trending songs. After playing the song snippet, the user will input their guess on the song, and the output will be the user&#39;s score at the end of the quiz. . Data Abstraction . The data will be the user&#39;s guesses, collected at each question and in lists. Once the timer runs out, the data will be added together to provide the output, which is the score. The data will also be stored in a database to compare to other scores in the leaderboard. Also, there will be data collected from the user&#39;s personal Spotify account in order to create the personalized song snippets. . Managing Complexity . The amount of points rewarded will be different depending on how quick the user answers the question, and there is not specifically a set number of questions, the user will be given questions as long as the timer is ticking. The song snippets in each question will be provided from the user&#39;s own Spotify account, making the quiz much more complex. . Procedural Abstraction . The procedure is collecting data from the user&#39;s personal Spotify account, called song abstraction. This procedure creates an overall personalized quiz and experience for each user. . Algorithm Implementation . The main algorithm is collecting the answers that the user inputs into the quiz and giving the score, but collecting the song snippets to form questions will also be an algorithm. The sequence will be collection of data from the user&#39;s Spotify, then the generation of questions, then the user will complete the quiz, with the output score at the end. The selection will the user&#39;s choice in answer, which will be translated to a specific amount of points. The iteration will be the songs, and the points provided per questions according to the timer. . Testing . For the testing, I will record a video of me completing the quiz myself, and upon receiving the score, I will compare it to the other scores in the leaderboard. . Learning Preparation . Before beginning on this project, I will need to learn more about databases, algorithms, and iteration in data collection. I will also have to explore a lot to figure out how to incorporate the Spotify Web API into my project&#39;s software. . Additional Ideas . These ideas are some other concpets I may want to explore if Idea 1 is not right for me. . Personalized Playlist:- The user can either input their favorite artists and songs, or the system will automatically collect their data. Then, a personalized playlist of songs based off their collective music taste will be created. The user can also select the &quot;vibe&quot; of the playlist, such as upbeat or moody, and the playlist will be curated toward that. | Daily Diet: The user may check off their allergies or dietary restrictions, and this site will provide them with a list of recipes or dish inspiration to meet those restrictions. | . | .",

            "title": "Spider-Man Quiz (App Lab)",
            "content": ". Brainstorming Process . For my quiz, I wanted to choose a topic that I liked and was familiar with. At first, I wanted to do a quiz about music, but I thought that the questions may be too exclusive, as music is more self-expressive concept, so the quiz may not be enjoyable for everyone. I started thinking about what topics may have set material that could make for interesting questions. This led me to think more about trivia-based questions. As a character with an ingrained backstory and history, Spider-Man would make great trivia questions. Yes, Spider-Man-themed questions may be just as exclusive as music-themed questions, but the answers are set in stone, and not up to interpretation. . So, I went with a Spider-Man themed quiz. . Planning Process . First, I planned out how my quiz was going to run. How many questions it would have, how many answers for each question, how it would signify a correct or wrong answer. I also really wanted to include a point system. I decided to keep it simple with 3 questions and 4 answers just like the example quiz. I wanted to either have a pop-up or a different screen as a way to know if you got the questions right. . Then, I brainstormed potential questions I could include. I searched up Spider-Man trivia on Google as for inspiration as well. The questions needed to be simple and multiple choice based, with answers not too obvious, but not super tricky either. With Spider-Man having so many different adaptions, it was difficult to think of questions that wouldn’t contradict information of each the version. The very original comic version is very universal, so I based my questions off that. . Once I got all my questions, I envisioned the design of my quiz. How could I make it the most practical and user-friendly? I wanted a simple design with fun colors, but not distracting and flashy. I wanted images that contributed to the Spider-Man theme. For the correct and wrong screens, I took inspiration from the quiz site Kahoot, because it’s straightforward yet effective. To incorporate the point system, I wanted a scoreboard at the end of my quiz. . With all of these elements planned out, I was ready to start building my quiz. . Building Process . To start off and learn how to make the quiz work, I followed the code of the example. I created different screens for each question, as well as the start and end page. Then, I used buttons and OnEvent -&gt; function to make the quiz run as it’s supposed to. The questions are displayed and the top, the answer boxes are the buttons. By clicking the start button you’re led to the first question, by clicking the correct answer button you’re led to the “correct screen”, if you click the wrong answer button you’re led to the “wrong screen”, then the next question, and so on and so forth. . . To add a scoreboard at the end, I created a variable called “score” and set it to zero. To make the system add up points, for every time the user is navigated to the “correct page”, a point is added onto the score variable. If the user is navigated to the “wrong page”, then no points are added. On the end page, there is a display of text saying what you scored, using the data the score variable has collected. . . Result . My quiz includes a start screen, 3 questions screens, a screen to signify a correct answer as well as a separate screen to signify a wrong answer, and an end page. Specific buttons lead to the desired screens, for example, clicking the correct answer will send you to the correct page, which will have a button guiding you to the next question. For every correct answer, a point is tallied, and the total score is displayed on the end screen. . Play my quiz! .",

InfoDb = [] # InfoDB is a data structure with expected Keys and Values # Append to List a Dictionary of key/values related to a person and cars InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Annika&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Liao&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;April 26&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;liao.92127@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;N/A&quot;] }) # Append to List a 2nd Dictionary of key/values InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Lyndsey&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Couch&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;March 29&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;Hyden&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;lyndsey@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;Tractor&quot;] }) # Print the data structure print(InfoDb) . [{&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;Annika&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Liao&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;April 26&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;San Diego&#39;, &#39;Email&#39;: &#39;liao.92127@gmail.com&#39;, &#39;Owns_Cars&#39;: [&#39;N/A&#39;]}, {&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;Lyndsey&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Couch&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;March 29&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;Hyden&#39;, &#39;Email&#39;: &#39;lyndsey@gmail.com&#39;, &#39;Owns_Cars&#39;: [&#39;Tractor&#39;]}] . Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet, to applications, or preparing it to be stored into a database -Exchange of data between programs includes the data type the method/function and the format of the data type | Application Programming Interface (API): write functions, receive, and return data. | . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . # print function: given a dictionary of InfoDb content def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop algorithm iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() . For loop output Annika Liao Residence: San Diego Birth Day: April 26 Cars: N/A Lyndsey Couch Residence: Hyden Birth Day: March 29 Cars: Tractor . Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . # while loop algorithm contains an initial n and an index incrementing statement (n += 1) def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() . While loop output Annika Liao Residence: San Diego Birth Day: April 26 Cars: N/A Lyndsey Couch Residence: Hyden Birth Day: March 29 Cars: Tractor . Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . # recursion algorithm loops incrementing on each call (n + 1) until exit condition is met def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) . Recursive loop output Annika Liao Residence: San Diego Birth Day: April 26 Cars: N/A Lyndsey Couch Residence: Hyden Birth Day: March 29 Cars: Tractor .",

            "content": "Honors Humanities . Principes and Elements of Design . Elements of design . Elements of design are structural parts of a work of art, which must be used according to principles of design in order to produce satisfactory work. Design is a structure of art with the elements and principles unifying the different parts and giving the work visual order. The elements and principles are always used in combination and therefore work together to create a work of art with good design. . SPACE: is absolutely necessary to all works of art because other elements are composed and developed within it. It can extend in either two (2-D) or three (3-D) dimensions. Space has no meaning until its limits are determined and its existence used. . FORMAT: once an artist has determined the size and shape of the area in which a work of art will be created, that area is referred to as the format. POSITIVE SPACE: the interior area of a shape, object, or form. NEGATIVE SPACE: the area exterior to, surrounding, or between shapes, objects, or forms. . LINE: is a basic structural element of art; all works of art have linear aspects. Paul Klee said, “A line is a dot going for a walk.” Lines may express response or excitement, strength or weakness, or other conditions. Lines have five characteristics: . LENGTH: short, long, continuous. WIDTH: thick, thin, carrying ATTITUDE: vertical, horizontal, diagonal CURVATURE: straight, shallow, tight TEXTURE: hard, soft, vibrant . SHAPE: the shape is produced by a continuous line connecting with itself; is usually regarded as a two-dimensional flat object. . FORM: usually regarded as three-dimensional objects or a shape that has the appearance of depth. . MASS: Bulk, weight, and density of three-dimensional forms, either actual or implied. . VOLUME: Any three-dimensional quantity that is bound or enclosed, whether solid or void. . COLOR: is a quality of visual sensation usually evoked by light stimulating the cones of the retina of the eye. Color has four qualities: . HUE: the generic name of a color, such as red, yellow, etc. INTENSITY: the brightness or dullness of a color. VALUE: the lightness or darkness of a color. Helps us understand two-dimensional art TEMPERATURE: the warm or cool quality in the appearance of a color, for example orange is a warm color, and green is a cool color. . TEXTURE: denotes the surface tactile qualities, usually described as being rough, smooth, coarse or fine, shiny or dull. The texture is understood through the sense of light. TRUE (actual) TEXTURE: occurs when the surface feels as it appears. Easily found in nature. FALSE (implied) TEXTURE: occurs when the actual surface appears to be a texture other than what it is; usually found in works of art. Principles of Design A principle is a rule to be followed in creating a design or composition. Design in the structure of art, with the elements and principles unifying the different parts and giving the work visual order. The elements and principles are always used in combination and therefore work together to create a work of art with good design. . BALANCE: equality of visual weight achieved through the use of one or more elements or design. SYMMETRICAL (formal) BALANCE: occurs when the elements on one side of the center are identical (but mirrored) to those of the other side. Asymmetrical (informal) BALANCE: occurs when the elements on one side of the center are not identical to those on the other, yet appear visually equal. RADIAL BALANCE: is similar to formal balance, but based on a circle with the center focal point. . UNITY: harmonious relationship of parts creating a single main idea, emotion, or point of view; obtained by relating elements of design to each other. REPETITION: unity is obtained by repeating specific elements of design to produce patterns and rhythms. PROGRESSION (movement): elements that cause the eye to move through a composition. . PATTERN: pattern uses the art elements in planned or random repetitions to enhance surfaces of paintings or sculptures. Patterns often occur in nature, and artists use similar repeated motifs to create patterns in their work. Pattern increases visual excitement by enriching the surface interest. . MOVEMENT: Artists to direct viewers through their work, often to focal areas, use visual movement. Such movement can be directed along lines, edges, shapes, and colors within works, but moves the eye most easily on the paths of equal value. . &lt;- Ex: bc lines are used to replicate movement when not moving . EMPHASIS: that part of a composition that is most important presents the main idea of the work of art. DOMINANCE: provides a center of interest, attracts attention, or makes one part of the composition appear most important. DOMINANT: the most prominent principle of the most obvious in the influence of position. THEME &amp; VARIATION: an idea or dominant feature that gives the artwork its character; the subject of a work of art, sometimes with a number of phases or different examples. SUBORDINATION (sub-dominance): those elements that are less dominating but provide interest and background into the composition. REST AREAS: those places within a composition that are relatively vacant, often regarded as negative shapes or spaces. . RHYTHM: visual movement achieved as the viewer’s eyes progress throughout a composition, moving and resting in regular or varied measures. REPETITION: of colors, shapes, textures, lines, etc. . HARMONY: the appearance of visual order obtained by relating elements of design to each other to create a sense of unity. APPROPRIATENESS: suitability of fitness of an idea, theme motif, or purpose to elements, media, or materials used in the creation of a work of art. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) . The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it. . . Interactive Charts With Altair . Charts made with Altair remain interactive.

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
